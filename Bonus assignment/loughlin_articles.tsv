The other high-profile actress charged, Lori Loughlin, removed her accounts on Tuesday.

Huffman's parenting website, What the Flicka?, also appeared to be taken down, according to Entertainment Tonight.

Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 — disguised as a tax-deductible charitable contribution — to a foundation operated by William Singer, who in turn, allegedly arranged for a particular proctor to ensure Huffman's daughter scored well. Her husband, actor William H. Macy, is not named in the indictment, but he is repeatedly referred to as Huffman's ""spouse.""

Huffman was released on $250,000 bond on Tuesday.

Just a few weeks before being charged, Huffman had tweeted a ""throwback"" photo with Macy, calling him her ""partner in crime.""

Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 as part of a bribery plot to help their daughters gain admittance to the University of Southern California.

Loughlin was not brought into custody with everyone else charged because she was out of the country. Before she turned herself in Wednesday, her social media accounts were deleted. She was released Wednesday on $1 million bond.

The Hallmark Channel's parent company, Crown Media Family Networks, said Thursday they are no longer working with Loughlin, who had been a staple of the network.

Loughlin's daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli, is also feeling the backlash to the scandal.

John Legend addressed the national college admissions scam involving Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman while attending the iHeart Radio Music Awards on Thursday, March 14.

The 10-time Grammy winner, 40, admitted to Entertainment Tonight that while he went to a “good school” — Legend graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1999 — the scandal is illustrative of a broken structure in general. “I think it’s a longer conversation, because I think a lot of people look at this, rightly, as fraudulent and dishonest, but the bottom line is, the system’s been rigged for wealthy people for a long time,” he said.

The “All of Me” crooner went on to give examples of what he viewed as problematic loopholes in the process: “The admissions system rewards people’s parents being wealthy and people’s parents having gone to a certain school,” he told ET. “There’s a lot of legal ways to do that that still aren’t really that fair to a lot of other people.”

He’s not the only celeb to have weighed in on the controversy: Others stars, including Rob Lowe, Bethenny Frankel and Legend’s own wife, Chrissy Teigen, have also spoken out on the incident.

The model, 33, poked fun at the scandal with a Photoshopped image of herself, Legend, celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin and Atkin’s husband, Mike Rosenthal, superimposed onto soccer players’ faces on Twitter on Wednesday, March 13.

“Does this look real? we are trying to get into harvard,” she captioned the shot. She also commented on her own post, writing, “I feel like mine could pass.”

Loughlin, 54, and Huffman, 56, were both indicted for allegedly paying bribery sums of $500,000 and $15,000, respectively, in order for their children to be admitted to college.

The Full House alum was arrested on Wednesday and released later that night on a $1 million bond. She is scheduled to appear in court on March 29.

Huffman, for her part, held hands with husband William H. Macy for her Friday, March 15 court appearance. She was arrested at gunpoint on Tuesday, March 12, and let go on a $250,000 bond.

Lori Loughlin Dropped by 'Fuller House' and Hallmark

Exclusive Details

7:50 PM PT - Our intel is clear -- Lori's not coming back to ""Fuller House."" A well-placed production source tells TMZ, ""Fuller House is not currently in production. Lori is a guest star and was during the previous 4 seasons and there are currently no plans for her to return to the 5th season."" Translation ... she's gone from the show.

6:56 PM PT -- Hallmark has now addressed their show, ""When Calls the Heart,"" which is now in the middle of airing its 6th season and stars Loughlin, saying, ""The series will not air on Sunday, March 17. We are evaluating all creative options related to When Calls the Heart series.""

With 7 episodes to go for the season, that must be a busy writers' room.

2:50 PM PT -- Tresemme has also announced they are cutting ties with Olivia. They stated, ""We take this very seriously and are no longer working with Olivia.""

12:35 PM PT -- Hallmark has cut ties with Lori Loughlin, a longtime collaborator with the company. In a statement Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, says it is no longer working with Lori and has stopped development of all productions she's involved in, adding it was ""saddened"" by the allegations.

Hallmark's first tragic ending ever. That's a shame.

12:08 PM PT -- Olivia's page with clothing brand Princess Polly is no longer active ... we've reached out to the company to see if the line has been completely shelved, but no word back so far.

Lori Loughlin's alleged cheating is already costing her daughter, Olivia Jade -- 'cause Sephora just kicked the kid to the curb in the wake of the college admissions scandal.

A honcho for Sephora -- which had a partnership with Olivia -- tells TMZ, ""After careful review of recent developments, we have made the decision to end the Sephora Collection partnership with Olivia Jade, effective immediately.""

Olivia had a makeup partnership with the cosmetics chain that produced the Olivia Jade x Sephora palette. That page on Sephora's website has been 86'd.

Lori's youngest daughter has been catching the bulk of the backlash since her mom and dad were indicted for allegedly paying bribes to get their kids into USC.

TMZ broke the story ... Olivia was on Rick Caruso's yacht in the Bahamas with his daughter when the indictment news broke ... Caruso -- the Chairman of USC's Board of Trustees -- tells us that Olivia is no longer on his yacht, and has since gone home.

USC has yet to decide Olivia's fate.

“We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin including Garage Sale Mysteries, an independent third party production,” the statement continued.

Along with stopping any current projects, the network will no longer air past content featuring Loughlin.

The actress has become a staple on the channel over the years, starring in numerous movies, TV shows and specials. She is currently starring as a series regular on Hallmark’s drama When Calls the Heart, which is currently in its sixth season. A representative for Hallmark told PEOPLE that the series will not air on Sunday, March 17.

“We are evaluating all creative options related to When Calls the Heart series,” the rep said.

Loughlin, 54, is among dozens charged in an alleged college admissions scam involving elite colleges and universities including Yale, Georgetown, the University of Southern California and Stanford. Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid $500,000 to make it appear that their daughter had been a rower, the indictment states. (Olivia Jade is not currently listed on the USC women’s rowing roster. It’s unclear if she was aware of the alleged scheme, and she was not charged.)

Both Loughlin and Giannulli were both arrested this week — she on Wednesday and he on Tuesday — on a felony charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Giannulli appeared in federal court on Tuesday and was released after posting a $1 million bond. Loughlin made her first appearance in federal court on Wednesday in Los Angeles where a judge set her bond at $1 million, according to the Associated Press, the Orange County Register and the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

A source told PEOPLE that some of the pair’s friends have been distancing themselves from the couple in light of the news.

“Lori and Mossimo are finding out quickly who their real friends are,” the insider said. “It’s not like they are the victims of a crime. They are the crime.”

“Many of their friends don’t want to be associated with them right now,” the source added. “Their friends are shocked at the allegations.”

A second source told PEOPLE that in the wake of the scandal, those who know Loughlin are also saddened to learn of her alleged involvement in the crime.

“Lori has always been a no nonsense, seemingly together woman who knows what she wants and goes for it with zest. She exudes both confidence and folksy charm at the same time,” the second source said.

“This issue is shocking and greatly saddens many people,” said the second source. “I’ve heard she is devastated, and the whole family wants to hide from the world.”

The pair accounts for two of 50 people indicted as part of the alleged nationwide scheme, which broke on Tuesday when federal court records were unsealed in Boston. Other notable names include Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman and author Jane Buckingham.

According to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts, the widespread effort was made by wealthy families to get their children into top colleges by falsifying SAT scores, lying about their athletic skills, and more. It’s unclear if the children were aware of any of these alleged crimes.

A day after Hallmark Channel cut ties with Lori Loughlin, the actress looks to be out of Netflix's Fuller House as well.

Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli were among 50 people indicted in a nationwide college admissions bribery case earlier this week. She has had a recurring part on Fuller House, reprising her role from the 1987-95 ABC sitcom Full House. She appeared in 13 of the show's 57 episodes through season four.

The show will air its fifth and final season on Netflix in the fall. Filming hasn't started yet, and sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that production won't be impacted by Loughlin's legal issues as there are no current plans for her to return.

Netflix and Warner Horizon Television, which produces the series, declined to comment.

Loughlin was taken into custody Wednesday after being named in the indictments, which allege she and Giannulli paid $500,000 to a college prep business run by William ""Rick"" Singer to ensure their daughters would be admitted to the University of Southern California. Others named in the case include Hollywood investor Bill McGlashan, actress Felicity Huffman and administrators and athletic coaches at USC, Stanford, Yale and the University of Texas.

Following the indictment, Hallmark Channel said it was ending its relationship with Loughlin, a regular on the cabler's series When Calls the Heart and star of its Garage Sale Mystery movies. She also appeared in several of the channel's popular Christmas movies.

Sunday's episode of When Calls the Heart, which is in its sixth season, has been pulled from the schedule. Hallmark says it's ""evaluating all creative options"" regarding the show's future."

Following news that actress Lori Loughlin allegedly took part in a bribery scandal to get her two daughters into the University of Southern California, the Hallmark Channel announced it would be severing ties with her.

Now, as Deadline and TMZ report, she also might not return to her role as Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis — or Aunt Becky — on Netflix's ""Full House"" sequel, ""Fuller House.""

RELATED: Actresses Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin among dozens charged in college admissions scheme

Now, Loughlin is not a series regular on the show — she's a guest star — and the writers haven't yet begun writing the script for the fifth and final season, so there was no guarantee Loughlin was ever to appear in the final season. However, she has appeared in every season to date, so some might interpret her absence from the production as a glaring omission.

Netflix had no comment to SFGATE on the report, and Warner Horizon, which distributes the program, hadn't commented by press time. Deadline nevertheless reports that a ""final judgement could come as soon as the next day or so.""

Earlier this week, Loughlin, as well as her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli and dozens of other wealthy and prominent parents were accused of bribing university officials across the country to get their children into ivy league and top-ranked schools. In the case of Loughlin and Giannulli, they are accused of handing over half a million in bribes to get their daughters falsely listed as new recruits for the USC crew team.

Loughlin was arraigned Wednesday in a Los Angeles federal court and is currently out on $1 million bail.

Less than a year before Lori Loughlin was arrested for her alleged involvement in a nationwide college admissions scam, her daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli joked that she rarely attended school.

The YouTube star, 19, posted a vlog in May 2018 that documented her last day of high school. The video began with Giannulli putting on makeup and preparing do a senior prank with her classmates.

“I’m, like, excited to go … do the school prank,” the beauty guru said in the clip. “But I’m also literally never at school that I think … maybe they forget I go there. I’m just kidding!”

Three months later, the social media influencer faced backlash for saying she only wanted to go to college for “game days” and “partying.” She noted: “I said something super ignorant and stupid, basically. And it totally came across that I’m ungrateful for college … and it just kind of made it seem like I don’t care, I just want to brush it off. I’m just gonna be successful at YouTube and not have to worry about school. I’m really disappointed in myself.”

Giannulli and her older sister, Bella, 20, both currently attend the University of Southern California, but their status at the school is questionable in the wake of the scheme. A spokesperson for the university told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, March 13, “We are going to conduct a case-by-case review for current students and graduates that may be connected to the scheme alleged by the government.”

The girls’ parents, Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly “agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC,” according to court documents.

The fashion designer, 55, was arrested on Tuesday, March 12, and the Full House alum, 54, was taken into custody the following day. They both appeared in court and were released on a $1 million bond each. Actress Felicity Huffman was also arrested in alleged connection with the scam.

Olivia has not yet publicly commented on the scandal, but it is already affecting her career. The social media star has lost brand deals with Sephora and TRESemmé. Similarly, her mother was dropped by the Hallmark Channel.

“We are saddened by the recent news surrounding the college admissions allegations,” Crown Media Family Networks said in a statement. “We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin including Garage Sale Mysteries, an independent third party production.”

Sources also told TVLine that the Summerland alum is not expected to return to Fuller House‘s fifth and final season when it airs on Netflix in Fall 2019. Us Weekly has reached out to both Netflix and Loughlin for comment.

Lori Loughlin's 'Fuller House' Future Dim Due To Elite School Bribery Scandal

However, all options are being explored on how to take the already-filmed episodes of Heart forward without Loughlin, one source says.

The impetus to keep Heart going makes absolute sense when you consider that last week’s Season 6 debut of the small-town drama was the highest-rated premiere in the series’ history.

Having flown in on March 12 from filming for Hallmark in Vancouver, Loughin surrendered to the FBI and was arraigned Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles. She was released on $1 million bail bond, like her husband fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli was the day before.

“We are saddened by the recent news surrounding the college admissions allegations,” a Crown Media spokesperson told Deadline earlier today. “We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin including Garage Sale Mysteries, an independent third party production.”

Netflix has remained quiet about whether it plans to drop Loughlin or not from Fuller House. It might be a moot point as writing on the fifth and final season of the Full House sequel of sorts hasn’t even started and the once busy actor was a recurring guest in her famed Aunty Becky role.

The still-UTA-repped Loughlin and Giannulli were part of a yearlong investigation that also snared American Crime star Felicity Huffman and more than 30 other parents. The couple are accused of paying “bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC,” according to the 200-page indictment announced Tuesday.

Like the other parents, Huffman, Loughlin, Giannulli and now ex-STX board member Bill McGlashan are being charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud, according to the unsealed March 6 “Operation Varsity Blues” indictment.

A US mother has filed a $500bn (£375bn) lawsuit against the people charged in a university admissions scandal, claiming her son was unfairly denied placement.

Jennifer Kay Toy cited the ""despicable actions"" of the alleged conspirators as the reason her child was not admitted to some universities he had applied to.

A separate class action suit brought by current students has been filed against the universities named by US officials.

The students say a ""warped and rigged"" admission scandal cost them money.

Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among the 33 parents charged with conspiring to bribe, cheat on tests and fake credentials to get their students into elite universities.

On Thursday, Ms Loughlin was officially dropped from the Hallmark Channel, a television network she has worked with since at least 2010.

What are the lawsuits?

In her filing to a San Francisco court on Wednesday, Ms Toy said that her son Joshua applied to some of the schools mentioned in the US Department of Justice complaint ""but did not make the cut for some undisclosed reason"".

""I'm now outraged and hurt because I feel that my son, my only child, was denied access to a college, not because he failed to work and study hard enough, but because wealthy individuals felt it was OK to lie, cheat, steal and bribe their children's way into a good college,"" her civil suit states.

A separate $5m lawsuit brought by students from Stanford University claims they were deceived when they agreed to pay the fees required with each application. The students requested compensation for the fees.

Student Erica Olsen said she was rejected from Yale after paying $80 despite her ""stellar"" test scores and athletic ability.

""Had Plaintiffs known that the system was warped and rigged by fraud, they would not have spent the money to apply to the school,"" the lawsuit claims, adding: ""They also did not receive what they paid for - a fair admissions consideration process.""

Yet another suit from students at Tulane University, Rutgers University and a community college in Orange County, California has been filed against William ""Rick"" Singer, who pleaded guilty on Tuesday to racketeering for his role as mastermind of the criminal schemes.

Pulled from Hallmark

Lori Loughlin, who rose to fame in her role as Aunt Becky on the 1987 sitcom Full House and the 2016 Netflix reboot Fuller House, has been dropped from the Hallmark Channel.

""We are saddened by the recent allegations surround the college admission process"" the family-friendly network and greeting card company said on Thursday, adding that they were suspended her from any projects that she is currently working on.

She currently stars in the ongoing Garage Sale Mysteries movies and the series When the Heart Calls.

The network has decided to pull the March 17 episode of When Calls the Heart from the schedule.

“We are no longer airing the episode on March 17, but we are not cancelling the show,” a representative for Crown Media revealed to Variety.

“The show is one of our best performers in the Sunday night slot, and we are exploring all sorts of creative options moving forward.”

The news of the upcoming episode being pulled is quite concerning, but given the legal situation surrounding the embattled actress, it makes sense.

Hallmark has been known for family-friendly programming and having one of its most prominent stars all over the media for the wrong reasons does not exactly align with its brand values.

Loughlin has also lost her role on Garage Sale Mysteries, which was slated to return in August for another four-week run.

It's unclear whether the mystery movie series could continue with a new lead to keep the rest of the actors and staff on the show employed, but Hallmark is likely weighing up its options right about now.

""We are saddened by the recent news surrounding the college admissions allegations,"" the company said yesterday.

""We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin, including Garage Sale Mysteries, an independent third party production.""

Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli face charges of federal conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for their part in the college admissions scandal.

The pair allegedly paid $500,000 in bribes to secure their two daughters spots at USC. The two daughters were supposed to be part of their crew team.

The issue here was that the girls had never participated in crew. It has been alleged that the admissions board accepted pictures of the girls on rowing machines, according to the criminal complaint.

11	http://time.com/5551948/hallmark-lori-loughlin-college-bribery-scandal/	['Lynn Elber']	None	"(LOS ANGELES) — The Hallmark Channel cut ties Thursday with favored star Lori Loughlin, a day after her arrest in a college admissions scam put the family-friendly network and extended Hallmark brand in uncomfortable proximity to a national scandal.

“We are saddened by the recent allegations surrounding the college admissions process,” Hallmark Cards Inc., parent company of the Crown Media Family Networks group that includes the Hallmark Channel, said in a statement.

“We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin” and have stopped development of all productions with the actress for Crown Media channels, the statement said.

The company initially took a wait-and-see approach after a federal investigation of the scam involving more than 30 parents, many of them prominent, was revealed Tuesday. Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying bribes to gain their daughters’ college admissions.

Loughlin’s career and the Hallmark Channel were deeply intertwined. She’s been among its so-called “Christmas queens” who topline a slate of popular holiday movies, and also starred in the ongoing “Garage Sale Mysteries” movies and the series “When Calls the Heart.”

“It’s a feel-good, family values-type channel, and obviously scandal is the opposite of that,” said Atlanta-based market strategist Laura Ries.

There was more at stake than image. “When Calls the Heart” tapes in Canada, and a judge ordered Loughlin’s passport to be surrendered in December after grudgingly allowing her to cross the border for work until then.

Loughlin has not yet entered a plea in the case, and her attorney declined comment Wednesday after her first appearance in a Los Angeles federal court. Loughlin’s publicist and attorney declined comment Thursday on Hallmark’s decision to drop her.

Fallout from the arrests also affected their daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli, a social-media star who pushes products on her accounts. The 19-year-old University of Southern California student was dropped Thursday from advertising deals with cosmetics retailer Sephora and hair products company TRESemme, the companies said in statements.

Loughlin wasn’t exclusive to Hallmark. She’s reprised her role as Aunt Becky for Netflix’s “Fuller House” reboot of the popular series that originated in 1987 on ABC. But the sitcom represents a fraction of the streamer’s flood of programs, while Loughlin has occupied an increasing amount of Hallmark real estate since she starred in “Meet My Mom” in 2010.

She’s proved a reliable performer. Her 2018 holiday movie, “Homegrown Christmas,” was the most-watched non-sports cable program the week it aired. In February, the season six premiere of “When Calls the Heart” was watched by a series-best 2.5 million viewers, putting it behind only “The Walking Dead” in Sunday night cable dramas.

“They definitely have a formula and you do have to follow the formula. And if you don’t, they rein you back in and say, ‘You have to follow. This is our format, this is what we do,'” Loughlin said in an interview last year with The Associated Press about the Christmas movies.

She said the rigidity chafes a bit but called the result “heartwarming,” adding, “You go to bed and you don’t have any bad dreams.”

The New York City native with a sunny smile proved a good fit for the channel that specializes in romantic dramas and comedies with a wholesome touch, while her media-friendly personality allowed her to expertly tout her shows on her website and in TV appearances.

Then came Tuesday’s bombshell government allegation that Loughlin and her husband were among more than 30 parents who paid a consultant to ensure their offspring’s place in college with bribes and falsified exams. Prosecutors allege the couple paid $500,000 to have their daughters labeled as crew-team recruits at the University of Southern California, although neither is a rower.

Felicity Huffman (“Desperate Housewives,” ”American Crime”) was among the other prominent parents, including a lawyer, doctor and a venture capitalist, indicted in the scam.

Hallmark Cards, the Kansas City, Missouri, enterprise started in 1910, has moved quickly before to respond to any flare-ups, such as in when it removed a gift wrap from circulation after one person complained of seeing a swastika in its pattern.

Misbehavior may be unusual in the Hallmark world but is nothing new for Hollywood, with the fallout from sex and other scandals affecting celebrities and companies. But the white-collar crime Loughlin is accused of is akin to that of another unlikely scofflaw: Martha Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 of obstructing justice and lying to the government about a stock sale.

“She lost trust,” said Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys, a New York-based brand research firm. So did her empire, despite Stewart’s efforts to separate her personal actions from it: “Wrong — you’re the brand,” he said.

While Stewart may exemplify her business, Loughlin wasn’t the only engaging star on Hallmark’s roster. “Full House” co-star Candace Cameron Bure and Lacey Chabert are among its popular holiday movie stars, and another emerged this year as Kellie Pickler’s “Christmas At Graceland” ranked as the most-watched entry.

“There are other actresses out there, whether they find or develop another to replace her,” said Ries.

No one can stop watching the fallout over the ivy league college admissions scheme dubbed Operation Varsity Blues by the FBI. As actress Lori Loughlin stares down the possibility of up to five years in prison for her alleged involvement, her career and family are seeing enormous consequences. Her daughters are apparently dropping out of USC over fears of bullying, eldest daughter (the prolific vlogger and Instagram influencer) Olivia Jade has lost a lucrative partnership with Sephora cosmetics, and Loughlin has been dropped from Hallmark movies (RIP, Garage Sale Mysteries). Now Loughlin’s most famous role may be a thing of the past, for Deadline has spoken to an insider who says Aunt Becky might be dismissed.

According to Deadline’s “well positioned” source, “She’s toast, it’s over,” meaning that Loughlin will no longer be welcome in the Tanner residence as Fuller House prepares to film its fifth and final season for Netflix. The source notes that the decision hasn’t been finalized, but it’s as good as done:

While no official final decision has been made by the streamer or distributor Warner Horizon Television on still UTA-repped Loughlin’s Fuller House fate, I’m told the writing is pretty clearly on the wall. A final judgement could come as soon as the next day or so.

This news, of course, becomes incredibly circular when one recalls that a 1993 Full House episode called “Be True to Your Preschool” strongly resembles the racket that Loughlin is now being accused of embracing, all to gain prestigious college admission for her daughters who don’t care about education.

Meanwhile, Fox Business is reporting that Loughlin’s husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, is receiving the cold shoulder as well. Target, which carried the famed Mossimo brand until 2017, has issued the following statement: “We haven’t had a working relationship with Mossimo Giannulli in over a decade and we no longer carry any Mossimo branded products at Target.” While the apparently icy tone of those words is obviously open for interpretation, People reports that he and Loughlin’s social circle is also rapidly shrinking:

“Lori and Mossimo are finding out quickly who their real friends are. It’s not like they are the victims of a crime. They are the crime. Many of their friends don’t want to be associated with them right now. Their friends are shocked at the allegations.”

Cue the “Have mercy!” jokes. Loughlin and her husband, along with Felicity Huffman, are expected to make their next court appearance on April 29.

Huffman was arrested in her home and later appeared in a Los Angeles federal court where she posted $250,000 bail and had to surrender her passport. However, her husband, actor William H. Macy, has not yet been charged in the alleged bribery scam but did show up at the courthouse to support his wife.

LORI LOUGHLIN APPEARED ‘ARROGANT’ IN COURT WHILE FELICITY HUFFMAN LOOKED ‘MORE GENUINE,’ SAYS SKETCH ARTIST

Loughlin's fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, was arrested as well and posted $1 million bail on Tuesday. The ""Fuller House"" star didn't show up in court until Thursday and her bail was also set at $1 million. She'll have to surrender her passport in December.

The three celebrity parties involved have yet to enter a plea but are scheduled to appear in court in Boston on March 29.

The scandal, at least for Loughlin, has already made an impact on her career. On Thursday, a rep for Crown Media – the umbrella group that includes the Hallmark Channel – confirmed to Fox News that the company has cut ties with the 54-year-old star.

Reputations and careers aside, are the Hollywood stars facing possible jail time?

Fox News spoke with California-based criminal defense attorney Lara Yeretsian, who has represented celebrity defendants including Michael Jackson and Scott Peterson, about what possible jail time the two actresses may be looking at.

Yeretsian predicted that ""if convicted at trial, [Loughlin] could serve 37-46 months. But if she enters into a plea agreement, could have 27-33 month custody time or possible probation with no jail or go under house arrest.""

As for Huffman, Yeretstain thinks that ""if she's convicted at trial, she could serve 12-18 months in jail"" or ""if she enters into a plea agreement, 8-14 months but probation is likely for her.""

Yeretsian pointed out that ""there are a number of factors that can have an impact on the sentencing guideline range, including the amount of loss of money involved, the level of sophistication of the alleged conspiracy, the role the defendant has played in the conspiracy, acceptance of responsibility and criminal history or lack thereof.""

""In fact, if the court agrees that Loughlin and Huffman were minor participants in the conspiracy, their sentencing guideline ranges will be 21-27 [months] for Loughlin and 4-10 [months] for Huffman if they plead guilty as a result of plea negotiations,"" she added.

""The focus, in this case, should be on the masterminds and architects of the conspiracy rather than the parents and students. The masterminds enriched themselves off overzealous parents,"" Yeretsian stated.

""Prosecutors have mentioned that they are still deciding whether to file charges against some of the students. I would not be surprised if many of the charged parents cooperate with the prosecutors to prevent charges being filed against their children, the students.""

San Diego criminal defense attorney David P. Shapiro told Fox News that the fact Loughlin and Huffman are celebrities will play a large part as well in their sentencing. ""It cannot be overlooked that people are outraged over the privilege in Hollywood. That the elite are essentially buying their kids' way into a successful life,"" he said.

Olivia Jade Giannulli is having a rough week — the revelation that her famous parents (actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli) paid $500,000 to have her and her older sister Isabella accepted to USC as crew team recruits (though neither rows) has put a serious cramp in the 19-year-old’s influencer style.

The scandal (which, to make matters more ridiculous, broke while Giannulli was allegedly partying on a yacht owned by the USC Board of Trustees chair), has created a mess of epic proportions in Olivia’s Instagram comments section. Though she turned off comments in the first three photos on her feed, the rest of her posts are open season, boasting feedback that ranges from typical troll fare (“LIAR, CHEAT, NO HUMAN SOUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”) to more, er, on the nose (“Entitled kid and criminal parents”).

At this time, several of Olivia's key sponsors and collaborators have dropped her, including Sephora, Tresemme, and Lulus. But Giannulli has several other big name partners that have yet to publicly distance themselves from the vlogger, including Smile Direct Club, Amazon Prime Student, Dolce & Gabbana Beauty, Conair, Boohoo, Philosophy, Smashbox, Marc Jacobs Beauty, Calvin Klein, Amazon Fashion, and Neutrogena.

RELATED: Are Lori Loughlin's Daughters Dropping Out of School?

Despite the social media comments frenzy, Jade appears to be benefiting from the scandal in terms of exposure — she went from 1.3 to 1.4 million Instagram followers this week, while her YouTube subscriber count (nearing 2 million) appears to be climbing as well. Not to mention, the two-name moniker ""Olivia Jade"" boasts recognition that it certainly did not on Monday. So, in terms of her influencer empire, could Olivia be on the rise?

According to Hollywood Branded CEO Stacy Jones, the follower gain is likely ""driven by many people who are just now hearing her name for the first time"" and are curious as to how she'll proceed. ""However, these aren’t people who are likely to stick around for the long run, nor be influenced to buy the products she posts about,"" Jones told InStyle.

As for the vitriol in the comments section, Jones thinks it may be a top factor in brand's decisions to drop Giannulli. ""She is dealing with potentially a very hostile tween and teen following right now, who are very quick to be socially outspoken and judgmental based on a perceived group outlook, versus their own true thoughts.

Hallmark Channel

It was the latest installment of the long-running Garage Sale Mysteries movie series that Loughlin was working on this week when the FBI and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts announced the nationwide indictments.

No word yet from Netflix about whether it plans to dump Loughlin from Fuller House. It might be a moot point as writing on the fifth and final season of the Full House sequel of sorts hasn’t even started.

The UTA-repped Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were part of a yearlong investigation that also snared American Crime star Felicity Huffman and more than 30 other parents. The couple are accused of paying “bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC,” according to the 200-page indictment announced Tuesday.

Taken into custody on Wednesday, the Aunt Becky of Full House and now Fuller Housepreliminary hearing fame was arraigned before Judge Steve Kim. Like her husband, Loughlin was released on a $1 million bail bond. Also like Giannulli, the actor is allowed only to travel only within the continental U.S. ahead of a set for March 29 in Boston.

However, unlike Huffman, who was released on a $250,000 bail bond already on March 12, and Giannulli, Loughlin reluctantly was granted the ability to travel to Vancouver for work on the multiple Hallmark projects she had signed on for.

The 19-year-old YouTube star has “no plans to return to USC” when classes resume on Monday, following her mom’s indictment and arrest for her alleged involvement with the college fraud scandal.

“She can’t handle anything right now. She seems more and more upset every day. She just wants to stay home,” says the source.

Although it is unclear whether or not Olivia Jade was aware of her parents’ involvement in the scandal, her booming Instagram and YouTube blogging business has taken a hit since the news broke. On Thursday, Sephora severed ties with the teen.

“She feels she has worked very hard to get different work deals and everything is just gone. She thought she knew what the future had in store for her, and it all just crumbled,” says the source. “It’s a never-ending nightmare for her. She understands the serious consequences her parents are facing and she is very scared.”

Olivia Jade’s older sister, Isabella Rose, 20, is also enrolled at USC, though her future with the school remains unclear. Neither of them was charged in the indictments.

Loughlin, 54, is among dozens charged in an alleged college admissions scam involving elite colleges and universities including Yale, Georgetown, the University of Southern California and Stanford.

Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid $500,000 to make it appear that their daughter had been a rower, the indictment states. (Olivia Jade is not currently listed on the USC women’s rowing roster.)

The colorful illustrations were immediately shared all over the internet. Artist Mona Shafer Edwards’s renderings depicted a weary-looking Huffman — awoken Tuesday by seven FBI agents with guns drawn at the family home she shares with actor William H. Macy and taken into custody — shrinking in her seat behind her fellow defendants.

A day later, Loughlin — who had the luxury of negotiating her surrender — was captured with full hair and makeup, glam but with defiant demeanor. They were “very, very different,” Edwards tells Yahoo Entertainment of Loughlin and Huffman during their days in court. “Totally different attitude, expression and the way that the body was held.”

The Fuller House actress (also commonly referred to as her character, Aunt Becky) had her arms crossed — and they stayed that way the whole time she was in court. “Kind of a defensive deflection like, Don’t touch me. What am I doing here? Where are my people? When am I getting out? It was so defiant,” says the freelance artist, who regularly covers court cases, often for ABC News. “Loughlin came off, and I think it showed in my drawings, a little arrogant. An illustrator can bring that out maybe more than a camera. However, I wasn’t being subjective. I was just drawing what I saw.” She adds: “The way people stand, their body language, their attitude — it all plays a part in an illustration.”

As for her outfit, Loughlin — who, along with her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid a $500,000 bribe to get their two daughters, including social media influencer Olivia Jade, into University of Southern California — dressed in a white turtleneck, which Edwards described as “like the good guy kind of thing. Her hair was perfectly styled, but it covered half of her face. And she wore the glasses. It was all kind of covering up.”

On the other hand, Huffman was arrested and brought right to court and looked worse for wear. “She didn’t have the time element Loughlin had,” Edwards notes. “So obviously she didn’t have time to call a makeup artist and say, ‘Hey, can you make me look great for court today.’” And where Loughlin was “defiant,” Huffman was sheepish, Edwards says. The Desperate Housewives actress, who allegedly paid $15,000 to falsify her older daughter’s SAT score, sat behind another defendant “so nobody could really see her. She had her head down most of the time until her name was called.”

Overall, Edwards says, “I think Huffman was more authentic and genuine.” Edwards admits she was “kind of concerned about the Loughlin drawing. I was thinking I made her too stern. But that’s what she looked like. There’s this thin line about whether I want to please the public and draw something [they’d like to see] or draw something warts and all, and I choose [the latter].”"	['warts', 'defiant', 'artist', 'huffman', 'loughlin', 'authentically', 'drew', 'shafer', 'courtroom', 'mona', 'kind', 'way', 'lori', 'huffmans', 'court', 'edwards', 'felicity', 'sketch']	"View photos Felicity Huffman in court on Tuesday, as captured by freelance illustrator Mona Shafer Edwards, who has covered trials of stars, including Michael Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and O.J Simpson.

The scheme entails wealthy parents that have bribed some of the most sought-after universities in the country with large amounts of money, in hopes to get their child admitted into the schools.

The money that was given was supposed to look like charitable donations, however, it is suspected that these wealthy parents’ “donations” actually went towards helping their children cheat on the college exam and using false information on the admissions application in order to secure their child’s acceptance into the prestigious schools.

In addition to 33 wealthy parents being charged in relation to this scam, CNN reports there are also nine different coaches, an exam proctor, and a couple of ACT/SAT administrators that are being charged as well.

On Tuesday, the Full House star and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest service fraud. So far, Lor’s time behind bars has only lasted for one day. The day after she was arrested, Loughlin was released on a $1 million bond.

With her release, many are wondering how this will affect her acting career and if she will be allowed to travel outside of the United States. We have all of the latest information about her arrest and the stipulations that were set by her bond.

Can Lori Loughlin leave the country?

On the day of her court hearing, Lori was currently contracted through the Hallmark Channel to film a show called Garage Sale Mystery in Vancouver. It has been reported that as long as she reports where, when, and how long she will be traveling, she will be able to continue to travel to British Columbia and work in Vancouver. However, she may not be able to travel out of the country next year because the O.C Register reports she will have to surrender her passport in December.

It was nice of the courts to grant Loughlin the provision that allows her to still work on her show. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like she will need the special allowance because recently, Crown Media announced it will no longer be working with the Fuller House Star. On Thursday, the family-friendly network released a statement regarding Loughin’s future with her current Hallmark productions; “We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped developments of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin including Garage Sale Mystery, an independent third party production.”

Could Lori be going from ‘Fuller House’ to “The Big House?”

We have seen many cases in the past where celebrities seem to be able to break the law while only receiving a slap on the wrist. However, the prosecutors in this case don’t seem like they are willing to take it easy on their wealthy suspects. In reference to this case, US Attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling stated “This case is about widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I’ll add that there will not be a separate criminal justice system either.”

Although, as of right now, there is no way to know if Lori will face jail time or not. However, according to a legal analyst for CNN, the beloved “Aunt Becky” could be facing anywhere for 27 to 46 months in the big house.

The investigation is still ongoing and it is anybody’s guess to whether or not Lori and/or her husband will be convicted of this crime. But no matter if she gets convicted or not, the allegations that she is facing have already altered her life and her future career."

Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman continue to face fallout from a sweeping college admissions scheme after a furious California mother filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the actresses and other elites.

Jennifer Kay Toy, a former Oakland school teacher, filed a $500 billion (yep, with a B!) class action lawsuit Wednesday against defendants named in ""Operation Varsity Blues,"" claiming ""legitimate applicants to colleges were denied access due to the illegal activities.""

In the lawsuit, Toy said her son Joshua wasn't admitted to several universities where the massive cheating scandal took place, despite having a 4.2 grade point average.

""I'm outraged and hurt because I feel that my son, my only child, was denied access to a college not because he failed to work and study hard enough but because wealthy individuals felt that it was OK to lie, cheat, steal and bribe their children’s way into a good college,"" Toy said.

She added that Joshua's ""rights to a fair chance at entrance to college was stolen,"" although she did not specify which universities her son applied to.

""I'm now aware of the massive cheating scandal wherein wealthy people conspired with people in positions of power and authority at colleges in order to allow their children to gain access to the very colleges that Joshua was rejected from,"" Toy said. ""I'm not a wealthy person, but even if l were wealthy l would not have engaged in the heainous (sic) and dispicable (sic) actions of defendants.""

Loughlin, her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, and Huffman are among the listed defendants, whom Toy accused of defrauding and inflicting emotional distress.

In all, Toy contends more than 1,000 people were involved in the scandal and says she intends to name all of them in the lawsuit, which she has brought ""on behalf of all persons in the United States.""

The lawsuit was filed in California Superior Court Wednesday, a day after the Justice Department charged 50 people in the largest-ever college admissions conspiracy.

Federal prosecutors charged 33 affluent parents, including CEOs, nine college athletics coaches and others in the sweeping bribery case to enter students into elite universities and colleges. The elaborate conspiracy involved cheating on the SAT and ACT and parents paying coaches ""enormous sums"" to get their children into schools by fabricating their athletic credentials.

The schools include Yale, Georgetown and Stanford universities, the University of Southern California, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Texas and Wake Forest University.

It is clear that the charges are not to be taken lightly, given that a federal judge set bail for Huffman and Loughlin at $250,000 and $1 million, respectively. Additionally, Loughlin has already been hit with professional repercussions as a result of the charges against her, with recent reports claiming that she has since been dropped by both the Hallmark Channel and Netflix’s Fuller House. However, are the charges serious enough to actually land the two actresses behind bars?

According to the charges, Huffman paid $15,000 in order for her eldest daughter to obtain a better score on the SAT’s, and Loughlin paid $500,000 in bribes to ensure that her two daughters would be labeled as crew recruits in order to gain admission to USC. These actions fall under mail fraud, one of the most common felonies and typically punishable by up to five years of prison time an individual and/or a fine of up to $250,000. While stringent punishment is always a possibility in federal cases, if Huffman and Loughlin continue to cooperate with authorities and show contrition for their alleged crimes, then in all likelihood the pair will walk away with a hefty fine and perhaps probation.

The issues of wealth and privilege in this country have also taken center stage in the scandal, and the Justice Department certainly wants to send a message that deep pockets do not mean a person is above the law. According to Andrew Lelling, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts of the charges, the parents involved in the conspiracy were able to give their children “every legitimate advantage” but “chose to corrupt and illegally manipulate the system for their benefit.” He then added: “There will not be a separate admissions system for the wealthy. And there will not be a separate criminal justice system either.”

Loughlin and Huffman won’t be let off with a simple slap on the wrist, but given that this was a nonviolent crime and that the pair do not have criminal histories, odds are that neither of them will see in the inside of a prison cell. And considering the staggering amount of evidence against the conspiring parents -- in the form of documents, emails and wiretapped calls – Loughlin and Huffman would be wise to come clean in order to try avoiding a heftier sentence."

Edwards’ colorful sketches of actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman facing the judge for their alleged involvement in a massive college admissions scandal quickly spread throughout social media. Cameras were not allowed inside the courtroom.

LORI LOUGHLIN'S DAUGHTERS STILL ENROLLED IN USC

Yahoo! Entertainment reported Friday the freelancer was determined to portray the players in the high-profile scheme accurately. One of her illustrations showed a weary-looking Huffman, 56, who was awoken Tuesday by seven FBI agents, with guns drawn, at the family home she shares with William H. Macy and taken into custody. In court, the fallen star was shrinking in her seat behind her fellow defendants.

But according to Edwards, Loughlin, 54, managed to surprise her.

“[They were] very, very different,” Edwards told the news site about the two women during their days in court. “Totally different attitude, expression and the way that the body was held.”

Unlike Huffman, Loughlin had the luxury of negotiating her surrender and appeared in court with full hair and makeup done, along with a defiant look. While sitting, the “Fuller House” star had her arms crossed and they stayed that way the whole time.

“Kind of a defensive deflection like ‘Don’t touch me. What am I doing here? Where are my people? When am I getting out?’ It was so defiant,” said Edwards, who regularly covers court cases. “Loughlin came off, and I think it showed in my drawings, a little arrogant. An illustrator can bring that out maybe more than a camera. However, I wasn’t being subjective. I was just drawing what I saw.”

“The way people stand, their body language, their attitude — it all plays a part in an illustration,” added Edwards.

Edwards said Loughlin dressed in a white turtleneck, which she described as “like the good guy kind of thing.”

“Her hair was perfectly styled, but it covered half of her face,” said Edwards. “And she wore the glasses. It was all kind of covering up.”

Edwards admitted she was concerned about her Loughlin drawing.

“I was thinking I made her too stern,"" she said. ""But that’s what she looked like. There’s this thin line about whether I want to please the public and draw something [they’d like to see] or draw something warts and all and I chose [the latter].”

Some commenters have pointed out Edwards’ sketch of Loughlin resembled first lady Melania Trump. Edwards said she found the comparisons comical, but stressed, “That didn’t even dawn on me.”

“Maybe because of the turtleneck,” said Edwards. “Melania wears a lot of turtlenecks.”

Huffman, who was arrested and brought right to court, wasn’t given the Hollywood treatment when it came to her appearance. Unlike Loughlin, the “Desperate Housewives” actress was arrested and brought right to court.

“She didn’t have the time element Loughlin had,” said Edwards. “So obviously she didn’t have time to call a makeup artist and say, ‘Hey, can you make me look great for court today?’”

Instead, Huffman sat behind another defendant and kept her head down until her name was called.

“I think Huffman was more authentic and genuine,” noted Edwards.

As for Macy, 69, Edwards managed to capture an up close and personal portrait as she was seated right next to him.

“I said hello, he said hello,” she recalled. “Then I started the drawing — and I’m drawing his wife — while he’s sitting literally three inches from me. The sketch of him, he’s literally touching shoulders with me. He leaned over and said, ‘You are really good.’ I said, ‘Thank you.’”

Edwards said there was a tense moment when another sketch artist tapped Macy on the shoulder and asked, “Would you tell me who your wife is?” He responded, “I will not.” Edwards apologized for her colleague’s behavior to avoid any awkwardness.

“At that point, he was like my friend,” she said.

Edwards added Macy had books with him and was reading until Huffman had to speak with the judge.

“When his wife stood up and was talking, he, of course, looked very intense and emotional,” she said.

When the proceedings were over, Macy thanked Edwards for drawing him.

“I said, ‘I wish it was in a different situation — someplace else,’” said Edwards. “And I wished him all the best. He put his hand on my shoulder, thanked me and said to have a good day. It was a very pleasant and respectful kind of thing.”

Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were out in $1 million bonds respectively after allegedly paying $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters designated as recruits for the University of Southern California’s crew team, despite the fact that neither of them participated in the sport.

Huffman, meanwhile, was released on $250,000 bond after allegedly paying $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation so that her daughter could take part in a somewhat rigged college entrance-exam.

More than four dozen people have been charged in the nationwide scam, which is alleged to have placed students in top-tier schools like Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, the University of Southern California, UCLA and the University of Texas. A federal investigation into the matter – dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" – has been ongoing for more than a year.

The fallout has begun for actress Lori Loughlin in the wake of her arrest this week for her alleged ties to a college admissions scandal, and for her daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli.

Loughlin was fired Thursday from the Hallmark Channel, on which she has been a staple, and beauty retailer Sephora announced hours earlier it has ended its partnership with Giannulli, who is a social media influencer.

""We are saddened by the recent news surrounding the college admissions allegations,"" the parent company of the Hallmark Channel said in a statement. ""We are no longer working with Lori Loughlin and have stopped development of all productions that air on the Crown Media Family Network channels involving Lori Loughlin including Garage Sale Mysteries, an independent third party production.""

The company also said all of Loughlin's completed work will be removed.

As for Sephora, the company told NBC News in a statement: ""After careful review of recent developments, we have made the decision to end the Sephora Collection partnership with Olivia Jade, effective immediately.""

Giannulli, 19, is a YouTube star and was a collaborator and paid influencer with Sephora. She released a bronzing powder palette with Sephora in December 2018. The $28, six-color Olivia Jade x Sephora Collection Bronze & Illuminate Palette was no longer available on the company's website Thursday. A search for the palette returns a message saying the product is not carried.

Haircare brand TRESemmé said in a statement Thursday it was ending its partnership with Giannulli. She advertised the brand's products on her Instagram page after attending a TRESemmé event during New York Fashion Week just last month.

Giannulli is in her first year at the University of Southern California.

Loughlin, best known for her role in the 1980s-90s sitcom ""Full House,"" was one of the dozens of people charged this week in connection with the $25 million college admissions scheme.

Federal prosecutors allege she and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 to bolster their two daughters' chances of gaining admission to USC.

Loughlin was released on a $1 million bond Wednesday after surrendering to federal authorities.

Giannulli was spending spring break in the Bahamas on a top USC official's yacht when federal authorities announced indictments in the scheme Tuesday.

She was on Rick Caruso's luxury yacht with his daughter Gianna, with whom she has been friends for years, Caruso told NBC News.

Caruso, who was elected chair of the university's board of trustees in May 2018, is the founder and owner of Caruso's, one of the country's largest privately-held real estate companies, whose holdings include The Grove in Los Angeles.

Once they became aware of the investigation, Caruso said, the women returned home.

A USC spokesman said applicants who are connected to the scheme will be denied admission and a case-by-case review will be conducted for students who are already enrolled at the university and may be connected to the criminal investigation.

""We will make informed, appropriate decisions once those reviews have been completed,"" the spokesman said. ""Some of these individuals may have been minors at the time of their application process.""

The fallout of Operation Varsity Blues, as it’s now being called, has been full of schadenfreude, to say the least. Actress Lori Loughlin, whose wholesome Full House image that had been the staple of the Hallmark channel (note, past-tense) for years is suddenly looking at five years in prison for shelling out $500,000 to get her ungrateful daughters into the University of Southern California — and people are absolutely riveted.

Of course, Loughlin did not act alone, as her apparel company-founder husband, Mossimo Giannulli, shares the blame for the alleged crime. And while there has been lots and lots of irony associated with Loughlin’s part in the scandal, her husband asks to kindly hold his fancy beer while he adds some hypocrisy to the whole thing.

According to Tom Arnold, just weeks before the scandal broke, Giannulli was sloshed at a Hollywood party going on about his support for President Donald Trump and how people should be “carrying their own weight.” Oh, do tell!

“Couple wks ago I got into it with for 10th time with #CollegeCheatingScandal DAD at big party cause his sloppy ass was rambling on again about Trump & people carrying their own weight & his own conservative politics being ‘right of Attila the Hun,'” Arnold, an outspoken Trump critic tweeted earlier this week. “He embarrassed Scandal Mom again.”"	['trump', 'frequently', 'complains', 'party', 'lots', 'loughlin', 'supporter', 'giannulli', 'vocal', 'carrying', 'scandal', 'loughlins', 'lori', 'arnold', 'husband', 'weight']	"Getty ImageThe fallout of Operation Varsity Blues, as it’s now being called, has been full of schadenfreude, to say the least.
Of course, Loughlin did not act alone, as her apparel company-founder husband, Mossimo Giannulli, shares the blame for the alleged crime.

""I don't really care about school, as you guys all know..."" - Olivia Jade Giannulli

Full House star Lori Loughlin is among the 50 parents who were indicted for ties to a college admission cheating/bribery scandal that was uncovered earlier this week. Her two daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose, are reportedly dropping out of USC due to the fear that they'll be bullied for their parents' unlawful actions.

Per reports, Olivia, 19, and Isabella, 20, are leaving the California school and will hold off from applying anywhere else for the time being. Olivia Jade, who is a social media influencer, also lost lucrative deals with Sephora, HP and TRESemmé in the wake of the scandal.

On her popular YouTube channel, Olivia Jade posted a video about how she doesn't care about school, but knows that education is important to have. ""I do want the experience of game days, partying... I don't really care about school, as you guys all know,"" she laughed in the vid.

The indictment claims that former Hallmark Channel staple Loughlin and her designer husband Mossimo Giannuli paid $500,000 to designate their daughters as recruits to the USC crew team, despite none of the girls participating in the activity.

Former Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman was also named in the indictment. She allegedly paid a proctor $15,000 to boost her eldest daughter's SAT score 400 points, with the hopes that she'd get into a better school."

The couple, along with over 40 others, has been accused of paying thousands of dollars to get their children into prestigious universities like the University of Southern California, Yale, and more.

Specifically, Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to have their daughters admitted to USC on rowing scholarships, despite their girls never participating in rowing activities before.

Giannulli faking his way through college

Fans of both the designer and Loughlin were shocked to find out that the parents had lied to get their children into school, but days before the news broke, their daughter Olivia Jade alluded to the fact that lying about education may be nothing new for the family.

“He didn’t come from a lot so it’s cool to see that he built it all himself,” she said of her father on the Zach Sang Show. “He, like, built his whole entire brand and he wasn’t actually, like, I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, ever enrolled in college. But he, like, faked his way through it and then he started his whole business with tuition money that his parents thought was going to college. That’s, like, such a different time. I don’t know if I was supposed to say that, but it’s okay.”

What’s even worse is that Jade had recently become a go-to source for girls applying to school .

“It’s the coolest thing getting DMs from girls being like ‘I’m applying to college right now, what did you do?’ she said on the show. “It’s fun!”

She even revealed that it was her parents who pressured her to go to school.

“Mostly my parents wanted me to go because both of them didn’t go to college,” she continued. “I’m so happy they made me go. That sounds so terrible, they didn’t make me. My sister goes to the same school and we are pretty much inseparable, so it was nice following in her footsteps in a little bit. I do like it.”

Olivia Jade’s partying ways

The YouTube star has also been under fire after a video of her saying that she was only in school to party resurfaced.

“I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend but I’m gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all,” she said while answering fan questions. “But I do want the experience of like game days, partying…I don’t really care about school, as you guys all know.”

Once she started receiving backlash from people calling her privelaged, she retracted her statement.

“I said something super ignorant and stupid, basically,” she said in a follow up video. “And it totally came across that I’m ungrateful for college — I’m going to a really nice school. And it just kind of made it seem like I don’t care, I just want to brush it off. I’m just gonna be successful at YouTube and not have to worry about school. I’m really disappointed in myself.”

Since her parents’ arrests, both Olivia Jade and her sister Isabella Rose have dropped out of USC.

I think there’s still so many great stories to be told,"" the actress said of the show's impending conclusion.

The final chapter of the Tanner-Fuller family will be coming to a close with the upcoming fifth and final season of Netflix's Fuller House and star Lori Loughlin doesn’t think the story is ready to come to an end.

""I don't understand why it’s the final season, I have to be honest with you,"" she told The Hollywood Reporter In Studio. ""I think it does really well for Netflix and I don’t know their business model. I'm not sure how it all works because it's not like network television, but I was surprised. I know it was 18 episodes, which is a bigger order than usual, but I'm still surprised that they’re ending it at season five.""

Fuller House, the sequel to the beloved 1987-95 sitcom Full House, premiered in 2016 and follows the grown-up lives of D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Candace Cameron Bure) and Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) and their longtime friend Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber). Original Full House stars Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier and Loughlin recur on the series.

Loughlin explained how she doesn’t want to see the series come to an end and is hoping to see it continue on another network: ""I think there's still so many great stories to be told, and who knows, maybe if Netflix says no more, maybe someone else will pick it up. Who knows?""

The actress has been a part of the Full House franchise since she joined the original series during its second season, but she didn't realize the love and devotion for the show until the Netflix spinoff was picked up in 2016.

""I always knew we were this beloved show, and generations had grown up on the show, but I think when it really came back as Fuller House, and that initial response was so overwhelming and it was so big, that I think that's when it finally really hit me,"" Loughlin said.

Goofing around: Olivia also posed for a silly snap with her mom and her mom's TV husband

Olivia took to Instagram on Sunday to post a photo of herself with her mom, John, and her friend David Dobrik, who is also a popular YouTuber.

The foursome sat in front of a trimmed Christmas tree and smiled for the camera.

'Merry Christmas from my fam to yours,' she captioned the snap, which has earned over 360,000 likes so far.

Olivia's dad is Mossimo Giannulli, who has been married to Lori since 1997. John, meanwhile, has been married to 32-year-old Caitlin McHugh since earlier this year, and the pair have an eight-month-old son, Billy.

But this weekend, it was all about Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky as they celebrated the holidays together.

David posted some photos as well, and John also shared several images from the day, captioning them: 'Merry Christmas from my fake family to yours.'

But the group wasn't just hanging out for the Instagram likes. Lori and John also appeared in a video for Olivia and Jade, in which the younger duo asked the older ones to figure out popular slang terms.

Lori has participated in these funny videos before, struggling to guess what it is, exactly, that the kids are saying these days.

In the new video, Lori and John both try and fail to define slang terms and phrases of 2018, including 'let's get this bread,' 'chief just called... he said this ain't it,' 'weird flex but OK,' 'she left the chat,' 'stan,' 'spill the tea,' 'sister shook,' and 'wig snatched.'

Real hair! Lori also joked that John wears a toupee — though Olivia promised that wasn't true

Hunk: They also goaded John into saying his Full House catch phrase, 'have mercy!'

Discussing the latter, Lori jokes that John doesn't like it when his wig is snatched, implying that he wears a toupee.

'He doesn't actually wear a wig!' Olivia promises.

Lori Loughlin is stunning, so it’s no surprise her two daughters, Isabella, 20, and Olivia, 19, are beauties themselves. The Full House actress, 54, posed with her girls in a plethora of photos on Wednesday, Dec. 19 in celebration of Olivia’s new makeup line that sells at Sephora.

For the outing, Lori donned a black satin blazer with black pants and a festive red and green bow. Olivia wore a black and silver sequin striped dress and Isabella sported a strapless deep v-neck red and black dress. The three looked fabulous if you ask us! ” Aww! Olivia is also a YouTube sensation, and in a previous exclusive interview , Closer Weekly asked Lori if her little girl comes to her for advice about being on screen. “Here and there, of course. I think the greatest thing I’ve done for her is getting her really good representation, so she has a strong team around her,” she said. “Her father, who started his own company, is also there to help. She knows she always has us While Lori is a notable and successful actress, she also takes her job as a mother-of-two very seriously. “I don’t ever view anything that I have to give up for my kids as a sacrifice,” Lori once told Closer . “I never thought, ‘Oh, my gosh, I had to give up that job.’ I said to myself, ‘If I bring human beings into the world, they’re going to be my priority.’ And I love them.”

She even added that she always considers them before taking on acting jobs. “I was not a hovering parent. I knew that I still loved acting and wanted to continue, but I made different choices so I wouldn’t be an absentee parent. When they were inquiring about me playing the mom on the new 90210, I said, ‘Where does it shoot?’ They said LA, and a lot of work has left LA, so I said, ‘I’m very interested.’ I knew it was a big ensemble and I wouldn’t have to work every day,” Lori shared with Closer. “I was so happy that after the first three or four seasons, I don’t think my kids even knew I had a job! Now that they’re on their own and their lives are full, I think about my schedule in terms of my husband, because I don’t want him to be left alone!” They’re the perfect family!

Now starring on several projects with the Hallmark Channel, Loughlin appears in Hallmark’s “When Calls the Heart,” a period Western series she adores.

On “Salon Talks,” Loughlin discussed her early experiences working on a soap opera at age 17, the most important lessons she learned in her career and how fans react to seeing Becky from ""Full House"" in the wild.

You began your career as a child actress and model.

Yeah, I started modeling when I was 11 and then did some commercials, and then when I was almost 16, I got a job on a soap opera. It was very random. They set me in on an audition and I got it and I did three and a half years on episode called ""The Edge of Night,"" which was phenomenal training for a young actor.

I wanted to ask you about that because I wonder what that must’ve been like. I started in front of a camera when I was about 15 — never commercials, but fashion — and it was such a surreal experience to go and be on a set. What was it like for you?

I was so green. I really didn’t know what I was doing, and I was really fortunate to work with a group of actors who really were theater actors, and the only reason I did the soap was so that they had a decent income, but every night when we wrapped, they would all go to the theater. They were either in a Broadway [or] off Broadway show, so everyone was so nice. They took me under their wing and they really helped me because I was total deer in the headlights. I had no idea.

You could only go to the show, not the bar, right?

Yeah, I can only go the show not the bar. I mean I literally was not quite 16. I was green as green you could be and then I remember it was the role of a dancer. When I went on the audition, first of all they said [to] lie about your age. I forgot to lie about my age and then the casting director almost let me walk out the door. She said, “Well, come back and read for me anyway.” I did.

She said I’m going to bring you back for the producers for Procter and Gamble — at that time, because it was a soap opera, P&G — and then she said, “I’m going to pair you up with another actor to read.” I’ll never forget. I read it with this lovely young actor. His name was Todd. I don’t know his last name. Right before he walks through the door he said to me, “You know, every time I read with an actress for a soap opera, she gets the role and I don’t.” Sure enough, I go and read and two hours later, I get a phone call that I had gotten…

He didn’t get one?

No, he didn’t get it.

I got it. I lied and said I could dance because it was the role of a dancer and then I got there and they had a full blown dance studio because they never said could you audition and dance? I thought that’s — my manager too was like, “They’re not asking you to audition. They probably just whatever, maybe do couple a of things.” There was full blown dance studio when I got there.

Uh-oh.

And a choreographer. Then I had to go in and tell the producers I lied and I thought they were going to fire me but then it was a character that couldn’t dance.

Do they write you into the script that you broke your foot?

That they couldn’t dance. I was just bad.

She just…

Yeah, it was just bad.

I see. There’s always a work around. It pays to have good writers.

Daytime television, you can work anything out.

What lessons did you learn early on about the film and television business?

When I was on that soap, I did learn that you are always replaceable and to be humble and thankful. I’ll tell you why I learned that lesson. They had an actor who was a main character on the show, Larkin Malloy, and he was hit by a gypsy cab one night in New York City, didn’t show up for work the next day. No one knew where he was. Finally, they located him in the hospital. He was in critical condition. That happened on a Thursday. On Friday they were auditioning, because it’s a daytime soap, auditioning another actor to replace him.

The show must go on.

On Monday, they had someone else to replace him and when he made a full recovery, which was almost a year and half later, they gave him his job back but they had someone else come in and fill his role for that amount of time. I will never forget when they walk this new actor in the studio and I was probably 17 and I thought, yup, don’t ever think you can’t be replaced because you can.

Smart. That’s true. At least they gave him his job back. Traditionally, you don’t get that back.

Advertisement:

They were great producers. They were nice people. It was a tragic accident. They gave him his job back but it was just a lesson that I took with me to always be grateful.

That’s good and it served you well obviously. You’ve had a long career. I did read that you turn down the lead role, this is well-known, in ""The Blue Lagoon.""

A long, long time ago.

Which I don’t really talk about because I don’t think it was meant to be and so I just, yeah. But that happened that was many, many years ago.

Advertisement:

You said, no thank you.

Yeah. Brooke Shields did it and she was the best. That was her role meant to be and I love Brooke. She’s a friend and I adore her.

Do people recognize you still the most from ""Full House?""

Yes.

Just constantly on the street.

Yes, I get a lot of recognition. I think because ""Full House"" has been on television for so many years now. It’s been in on in some form whether it was in primetime 30 years ago or over the years in syndication. We have generations and generations of fans of all different ages, so by far, I get recognize for that. Then I also do another series for Hallmark, the Hallmark channel. The name of it is ""When Calls the Heart."" It’s a period piece, a Western, and that show is really starting to pick up. We’re in Season 6 but a lot of people are watching that show now. It also airs on Netflix. I think being on Hallmark channel and streaming on Netflix has brought a lot of viewership to that show.

Having had such a long career, do people approach you differently or they just throw out lines from —

Do they scream ""Have mercy!"" at me? Sometimes. The sense that I get is that people feel like they know me, like I’m an old friend. They’re very warm and kind. The fans always seem to me very nice. They’re always nice to me and I’m nice to them.

""Garage Sale Mystery"" . . . is the latest installment in Hallmark Movies & Mysteries' popular garage sale mysteries franchise. It kicks off the channel's second annual Garage Sale Mystery month. That sounds fun.

August is Garage Sale Mystery month.

Tell me about Jennifer, who’s your character.

Well, we did this last year. First of all, ""Garage Sale Mystery"" was one movie for the Hallmark channel. It did really well and they decided that they would take their movie channel and rebrand that the movie mystery channel. Off of ""Garage Sale,"" they’ve now launched many different mystery series. But ""Garage Sale"" is their longest running. It does really well. Last year, they decided they were going to make August ""Garage Sale Mystery"" month and air a new movie every Sunday night. It did really well. They said, “Hey, let’s do it again.”

We are back this August every Sunday night with the new movie. Same characters. I played Jennifer Shannon. I own an antique store with my best friend, played by Sarah Strange. Kevin O’Grady plays our lead detective on the show, Frank Lynwood. It’s an old fashioned whodunit.

It’s like ""Columbo"" or ""Murder, She Wrote"" where you have to watch it to think about maybe who did it. There’s nothing too scary. Yes, there’s always a murder. There’s nothing graphic. Doesn’t keep you up at night. Won’t give you nightmares.

Speak for yourself.

Families can watch it.

Families can actually watch it, but I’m always frightened by like this . . .

No, Alli, you couldn’t be afraid of this.

. . . the traditional scene where it’s like the old lady at the top of the stairs . . .

She falls.

. . . this is very Alfred Hitchcock. She falls. Who pushed her? Everything's shadowy. That spooks me.

Who’s the audience for this, do you think?

I’ve had a wide range of fans come up to me. You would think it would skew heavily female, but a lot of men watch also.

Look at that. They just love you.

There’s a wide range from younger to older.

Were you interested in mystery as a viewer, as a consumer?

My mom is a huge mystery buff, always has been ever since I was a kid, and I grew up watching shows like ""Columbo,"" ""Murder She Wrote,"" ""McMillan & Wife."" All of those three and I would always sit and watch with her. Until this day, she’s 83. She’s always reading a mystery book, always. No matter where she goes, she has a mystery book in her bag.

It must’ve been bad for you as a bad teenager. Were you trying to sleuth out all the things?

No. You couldn’t. I try to sneak out one night and she caught me red handed. I thought I made it. My hand was on the door. I was with my cousin.

I literally had my hand on the door and my mom was behind us, “Girls, where are you going?” You can’t pull anything on her.

My grandmother was also a good sleuth. She used to stop me at the door because when I was a teenager you want to wear the inappropriate skirts that your grandparents think — and now I’m a mom I’m like, that’s too slutty, take it off — she would catch me. She would lift up my skirt to see if I had the shorter one underneath, then she’ll be like “Go back and change.” I always had the hot pants underneath.

That was funny.

Good mystery sleuth, you have to be as a parent.

Kind of had to be.

You have two girls, right?

Yeah. Here’s the problem today. Kids are so savvy and they are lightyears ahead of us as far as the computer, social media, all that jazz. I mean I don’t know. Your kids are still younger. Do they have Instagram yet?

No.

Okay, so they’re still younger. Well, then the kids…

I know it’s coming.

I found out, so you think they have an Instagram that you’re following but then… It’s a Finsta…

It’s Finstagram. I know.

It’s a Finsta and they have the fake Instagram.

Yeah, I know a fake Instagram. We’re not quite there yet but your point is well taken. It’s hard to raise children of either gender but especially girls and I know your daughter Isabella is also interested in acting.

Wants to be an actress.

Your experiences in Hollywood, good and bad, how they’d made you feel about your daughter’s future in the entertainment business since she’s in school?

I know. Well, she is in school and I’m glad. She just finished her first year of college and she really enjoys it and I think she’ll get her degree. And I just said to her, “Look, have some back up plan. Get a degree and something else. You can study theater [and] whatever you need to also at school.” I think I’ve shown her and presented all the pitfalls that there might be. I would be a hypocrite at this point to say no, you can’t do it, because I’m doing it. She sees me and I’m making a living. And then there’s a part of me that goes yes, it’s a hard business, but why not her? I mean it’s like me. I was kid from Long Island. I grew up…

Hauppauge, right?

Hauppauge. In a middle class household and my dad worked for the New York telephone company. The odds of me becoming an actress and even working were so slim to none but I did it. I think the same thing about her. Why not? I guess if you work hard enough and you pursue, you can. It’s a lot of luck but you can create that for yourself.

Absolutely. I always believe you make your own luck.

Yeah.

Has the #MeToo movement affected you or your daughters at all?

Not my daughters that I know of. They’ve not said anything to me and for me, I can’t say. I’m sure over the years people have said things that maybe nowadays would be off color or people would be offended. I never had anyone make some really egregious move or like hardcore move on me. I never had. I just haven’t, so. . .

That’s lucky.

Yeah, it’s lucky. Then there’s a part of me that goes, “Wait a minute. What’s wrong with me.” No, I’m kidding. All joke. I’m kidding.

You’re in Hollywood. You’re back and forth. Do you see historically, politically positive change or is it a lot of talking about change even though it wasn’t your personal experience?

I think we are definitely moving towards change. I just think by the fact that educating young men and women nowadays to behave differently in workplace and really having boundaries and teaching them what’s appropriate and what’s inappropriate. This next generation coming up, I think it will already be in the fiber of who they are and I think we’ve seen a lot of important or powerful people take a huge fall from grace because they’ve been exposed doing something that is not appropriate in workplace. I think that we’re definitely moving towards change. I think women are making great strides. I think people of diversity are making strides. I’m sure we still have a long way to go but I do think things are moving in a different direction.

At the very least, women have been involved in to speak up for themselves.

To say I’m not afraid, I have a voice, and I’m going to use it and I think as we’ve heard this voice over and over again, so many people are afraid to say anything because they’re afraid that they would be the ones who would lose their jobs and I’m sure in the past, people did speak up and they probably didn’t lose their jobs.

I think that still the case.

Do you think they still would let…

They’ve been around for a while. I hope that it changes.

Yeah. I’m sure people, they are always fearful. It’s interesting too that you can see nowadays how you can say one thing and it can be taken out of context or used against you in a way that you didn’t mean it. It is tricky and you could, to your point, you could see why somebody might be reticent to open up or speak their truth.

But I hope they do.

Yeah.

Because that’s really important.

It is.

Any goals for this coming year in terms of your career, what you want for your kids?

Oh my goodness. For my career, I’m really happy the way things are chugging along. I have a lot of work right now and I feel really lucky about that. My girls, I just wish for them always to be happy and healthy. I just continue to have a good relationship with them and just communicate.

Going to be tight with your girls. I have always wanted that. My mom and I were close.

Yeah, my mom and I are very close and I’m close to my girls too.

It’s lucky because a lot of women don’t have that with their mom, which I think will always surprise me, but I think it’s a terrible shame.

Roles for women over 40 . . .so your TV and movie career’s been going so well which is amazing. Have you seen a shift in the business in this regard? Because I’ve spoken with other actresses . . .

I think we are seeing a shift and then you’re seeing a lot of women that are of a certain age that used to do feature films that are finding homes on great television shows, whether it’s on network shows or cable or streaming channels. I think that they’re finding more roles and good roles. I think what’s great now is it’s just about the writing and people are really open to getting their work out there no matter how. Doesn’t just have to be on the big screen. You’re finding more and more that you can reach an audience in many different ways. Then, of course, one of the reasons I love working for Hallmark is because they are so good to women, actresses of a certain age. They’re very, very generous and employ me. They’re just great.

Obviously, as you said earlier, there’s so many more content outlets. You think there are more opportunities as well in tandem with media producers who are ecumenical in their choices of picking the best actor or actress, not because of their age but because they’re the best?

I think so and what I think is also interesting about the time that we’re now is there’s a lot of talent out there who can upload their own content and be seen and people are watching. Casting directors watching, responding. Kids that are on YouTube. That’s a talent and these kids are having careers but they’re jumpstarting themselves on the internet. My younger daughter has done that. She started a YouTube channel around makeup and beauty and now she’s an ambassador for Sephora and she wants to have her own makeup line one day and she’s totally moving in that direction, but she started that channel on her own. She did it all herself. I laugh. She’s a one-woman production company. She hosts the show. She edits the show. She adds the music. She does the graphics. She comes up with the content. She produces the whole thing.

You have to do that now. It could be scrappy as heck these days.

The day after the finale aired, the actor sat down with his now former co-stars Erin Krakow (Elizabeth) and Lori Loughlin (Abigail), as well as executive producer Brian Bird, for a Facebook Live to discuss the end of the season and Lissing’s reason for leaving.

“First and foremost, I want to say to all of our fans that the three of us here are very good friends, and we all love each other and we support each other,” Loughlin started off by saying. “But we are actors, and actors have contracts and sometimes contracts expire and you have a choice to make. You either renegotiate or you don’t, and Dan has chosen to move on, we respect that. No judgment. We love him; we wish him well. He’s still part of the Hallmark family.”

While he’ll be a forever member of the Hallmark family, and there’s nothing stopping him from acting in other Hallmark movies or shows in the future, his time on “When Calls the Heart” has now come to an end. This decision was a tough one for him, but an important one.

“Circumstances arose for me where I needed to leave ‘When Calls the Heart’ for reasons that are very personal to me,” Lissing said. “I went to Hallmark, and they were nothing but supportive of me. I went to the girls, and they were nothing but supportive of me.”

After he went to Hallmark with his decision to not renew his contract, the writers of the series were left with their own difficult decision to make - what they were going to do with Lissing’s character, Jack?

“We talked about, like, ‘Do we recast the role? No, we can’t recast the role. How can you recast the role? No,’” Loughlin, who is also a co-executive producer, said of their thought process behind deciding to kill off Jack. “The chemistry that these two have, we just didn’t feel like, the writers didn’t feel like that was possible.”

She continued: “We knew our time was limited with Dan, and the actor wouldn’t be coming back. So if we sent him off to the Northern Territories, now we have Elizabeth sitting at home in Hope Valley just pining away and waiting. Not much story to tell.”

The only other avenue they could’ve taken besides killing Jack would’ve been to have him relocate because of his job and break up with Elizabeth in order to not hold her back, but Loughlin said they quickly realized that that wouldn’t have been plausible because “the only way he would leave her is in death,” which is something that most Hearties can probably agree on because of the couple’s lasting romance.

Though he left on his own accord and not because he was forced out, Lissing maintained that it wasn’t anything about his character or the show that he disliked so much that he wanted to leave. Actually, it was the opposite. As he’s now walking away from “When Calls the Heart,” all he can do is think about what an amazing experience he’s had working on the project.

“It’s been the honor of my career to play Jack,” he said. “It has been the honor of my career to work with these two amazing women who I consider some of my best friends in the world. When I came out to the United States as a guy who was playing in bars in Sydney, to think that I would play a character like Jack on an American TV show is beyond anything I could’ve ever imagined.”

During the Facebook Live, Lissing was able to share his feelings about leaving, and Loughlin was able to explain how they decided on Jack’s death, but Lissing’s on-screen love, Krakow, also got the chance the share what’s been going through her mind about all of this.

“I was just sad that Dan was leaving,” she said. “That’s the bottom line: We were all really sad about it, and that’s hard. Dan, in many ways, has been my partner in crime for five years, and one of my greatest scene partners ever, and I’m just really gonna miss him.”

She continued: “This felt very special because these characters are all so close to me and all you have to do is think about it and the tears fall.”

Hearties know all too well about tears falling because there’s nothing that could stop that from happening while watching the emotional Season 5 finale of “When Calls the Heart” on Sunday. Luckily, this video with the cast helped clear up a lot of the questions fans were having, which means the next step will be waiting until Season 6 premieres next year for more answers."

The “When Calls the Heart” actress also has a holiday special for her Hallmark drama airing on Christmas Day, and Webster could last be seen on the network in the 2017 flick, “A Harvest Wedding.” The “Homegrown Christmas” cast also includes Gwynyth Walsh (Maddie’s mom, Peg), Kate Isaac (Maddie’s sister, Hallie) and Isabella Giannulli (Carter’s niece, Ava).

“Shoe designer, Maddie (Loughlin) sells her company and comes home for Christmas to ‘navigate the in-between with family,’” the synopsis begins. “Unsure of the reception she’ll get from her former beau Carter (Webster) or her sister, Maddie is ready to discuss the past but Carter and her sister aren’t ready, and both are busy with work and turning the barn into Santa’s workshop for the holiday dance.”

The synopsis continues: “Wanting to help, Maddie works with Carter on the barn, and the two can’t help but reminisce. Deeply in love, they broke up when she moved to New York to be the next Coco Chanel and he stayed behind, but now the two can’t deny they still have feelings for one another. Hoping to reconnect with her sister while falling for Carter all over again, Maddie decides to stay in her hometown.”

But just as soon as she makes that decision, a new opportunity comes knocking. A famous pop star asks Maddie to start a new shoe line with her in New York, and the designer must make a choice between her new hometown life or her life back in New York.

It was reported last week that Netflix is close to a deal for a revived Full House series based around DJ Tanner (Candace Cameron) and her best friend Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber) as adults.

Initial reports suggested that Bob Saget would be involved as a recurring star and producer, while Dave Coulier and John Stamos would make guest appearances.

Loughlin - who played Stamos's on-screen wife Rebecca Donaldson - acknowledged this week that she knows very little about the revival.

""I have not received any official phone call - nothing - and that is the truth,"" she told Zap2it. ""My agents, my managers, none of my representation has gotten a phone call. Nobody.""

Loughlin went on to clarify that she would ""certainly be up for"" a revival of Full House if a formal Netflix commission occurs.

""I think that they do have some kind of deal in place, but not with all of us,"" she explained. ""I've talked a little bit to John [Stamos], but it seems all very vague right now.

""The momentum seems to be moving in that direction. It certainly wouldn't surprise me if it eventually came to fruition.""

A reunion for the Full House cast was first reported last autumn, although Loughlin was quick to insist that no cast members had been contacted about the rumoured project at that time either.

Cameron has been vocal about her support for a Full House reunion since the Disney Channel brought back fellow ABC family comedy Boy Meets World.

Loughlin, who plays Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis, took to her Instagram on Friday to reveal some shots from the set of the Netflix sitcom.

The main post saw Loughlin posing with the rest of the Fuller House cast, including Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber and Bob Saget.

That same post also showed the curtain call for the episode as the cast greeted an enthusiastic live studio audience.

Also shown in the clips was Dave Coulier, best known as family friend Joey Gladstone on Full House and the current spinoff. However, Coulier was not appearing on set as his character. He instead is returning as the direcotr of the episode Loughlin and Saget are returning for.

""It’s always nice to go home,"" Loughlin wrote. ""Thanks [Dave Coulier] you’re a wonderful director!""

In now removed Instagram story posts, Loughlin also showed more shots of Coulier directing, as well as a look at what the episode's plot will focus on. Saget appeared in character as Danny Tanner, but he was decked out in a hospital gown. This signals that the Tanner family patriarch is be dealing with some sort of health issue that brings his daughters to his side.

Earlier in the week, Loughlin also shared another look at Fuller House season 4.

Loughlin is once again shown with several of her Fuller House castmates as they all pose for a selfie.

""Always a good time with this crew!"" Loughlin wrote.

While she stays busy with her Hallmark Channel projects such as Garage Sale Mystery and When Calls the Heart, Loughlin always loves reuniting with her Full House family.

She recently opened up to Hello Magazine about how the cast never expected they would still be close all these years later.

""We knew we had a great connection, but I don’t know that any of us could have ever known we’d have the friendship that we formed today,"" Loughlin said. ""We had no way of knowing that, or even the fact that the show would come back again after 25 years. No one would have [predicted] the show would have such staying power.""

She added, ""We have group texts. We email, talk or meet for lunch individually. John [Stamos, who played Uncle Jesse] will have a BBQ, I’ll have people over. Jeff Franklin, the creator of the show, is really good about always putting things together.""

Loughlin says the fan response to the revival has been overwhelming: ""It’s great to be back with the 'Full House' family. We’ve always stayed in touch over the years but it’s fun to be working together again ... and we are on the same sound stage that we were on together 30 years ago when we first started the show.""

LIVING A HEALTH LIFE. Beth Stern celebrated all things healthy at the Healthy Guru Wellness & Fitness event presented by KIMA Social Life Magazine at the Southampton Arts Center on Saturday afternoon.

We really just like to be together and go out with just a couple here and there. We like each other, we like being alone together, we really do and we share a passion for the animals that we are rescuing. We are just in tune, we're good."""

On Saturday, John Stamos posted an adorable birthday message for Lori Loughlin, and it featured a special throwback picture. These two actors have been co-stars for a long time, and they first appeared onscreen together as Jesse and Rebecca in Full House, which premiered in 1987. Stamos' post brought back memories of their early days on the series, and his message was a tribute to both their television roles and friendship.

The caption reads:

""Been Jesse to your Rebecca for 30 years. 30 more, then that’s it! I don’t for one second take for granted your talent, your heart and most importantly, our friendship. Happy Birthday Lori, XO"".

The post shows that these two have remained close pals over the years, and that neither star expects that to change. Loughlin and Stamos began their careers on the sitcom, which was popular throughout the late '80s and '90s. The series followed the story of TV sports anchor Danny Tanner, who recruits his comedian best friend Joey, and musician brother-in-law Jesse to help raise his daughters after his wife passes away. Danny becomes friends with another anchor named Rebecca Donaldson, who is played by Loughlin. Rebecca eventually falls for Jesse, and becomes part of the family.

Jesse and Rebecca ended up together on the show, and while Loughlin and Stamos never had a real-life romance, this birthday post shows that they remain close friends. According to The Today Show, Loughlin responded to the birthday wish, commenting, ""It's been a great 30! I'm so glad we've been on this journey together!! I love ya buddy!!""

In 2016, a sequel to the series called Fuller House premiered on Netflix, bringing the two stars back together onscreen. It turns out the whole cast of the reboot was by Loughlin's side on her birthday. On Saturday, she posted a group photo with Stamos, and her other co-stars Andrea Barber, Candace Bure, and Jodie Sweetin on Instagram. The caption read: ""So much love for this group!!!"" and was followed by several heart emojis. Bure, who plays D.J. Tanner, commented: ""Happy Birthday!!!! Love you tons and tons."" It looks like even though the actor spent most of her birthday on the set, the cast and crew made time to celebrate and have fun.

Stamos wasn't the only co-star to share a birthday wish for Loughlin. Barber posted a picture with the star from the Fuller House set, writing: ""Happy birthday to my beautiful friend Lori Loughlin, who has the best laugh, the prettiest smile, the funniest dog, and the biggest heart. I love you, Lori!"". Bob Saget also posted a picture with his co-star to Instagram, writing:

""Happy Birthday Lori. Always so sweet, so smart, so beautiful. So lucky to have you as a friend all these years. Let's make a real series out of ""Wake Up San Francisco."" Should play well in Kentucky. Love you.""

Ultimately, it's the bond between Stamos and Loughlin that fans can't seem to get enough of though. They've appeared alongside each other for over three decades, and built a pretty incredible friendship over the years. His sweet throwback post shows that they're still such good friends, and they're definitely keeping the Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky feels alive."

TV aunt extraordinaire Lori Loughlin took to social media to share a snap of her and a special someone — her longtime small screen spouse, John Stamos — as they sat on the steps of the iconic San Fran (OK, Warner Bros. lot, but you get the picture) Tanner townhome. Her Fuller House Season 4 pic of Uncle Jesse and Becky in all their stoop-tastic glory is too cute for words. With every passing year, this iconic TV couple gets more adorable. Great — now I have the song ""Forever"" in my head...

The Full House spinoff Fuller House premiered February 2016 in what feels like the early days of the '90s reboot craze. The series has been a streaming success for Netflix and it was confirmed in January 2018 that there would be fourth season to look forward to. The second half of the third installment debuted in December — the two-part season kicked off last September. A premiere date for Season 4 has not been revealed (fingers crossed for an announcement shortly), but from the looks of Lori's Insta, shooting for the upcoming episodes has begun. Have mercy!

Lori's not the only cast member posting on-set Fuller House moments. Jodie Sweetin, aka Stephanie Tanner, posted a sweet pic on June 12 with the hashtag #FullerHouseFamily.

On June 2, Andrea Barber, who plays Kimmy Gibbler, gave her followers a look at what she dubbed ""curtain call shenanigans"" using the hashtag #season4.

The actress also posted a photo of a script/baby bump combo (her character is acting a surrogate for Stephanie) on May 18, noting that she was gearing up for the ""first live taping of Season 4.""

Candace Cameron Bure, who began portraying DJ Tanner over 30 years ago, revealed her hopes for the future of Fuller House in an interview with E! News earlier this year:

What's most important to me is as much fun as we have on that show, it's always about the heart and lessons that are learned as families. I really want to make sure we bring that in in season four, even more than we have in any other season.

Candace and Scott Weinger (yup, Steve) clutched their coffees in a sweet snap from May 22. Uncle Jesse and Becky aren't the only Fuller House duo serving behind-the-scenes pics...

Whether you're a newfound viewer of the ongoing Tanner family chronicles you watched Full House as a kid, or you catch Fuller House now that your own child is a fan — yeah, the show's been around since 1987 — the series' reach is undeniable. I watched Jesse and Becky fall in love, clash over their wedding plans, get married after Jess landed in jail (it was a minor tomato-based crime), have twins, move into the attic — and they're still on my radar in 2018. That's something I did not expect as an elementary school student while witnessing Jesse's heartfelt proposal.

""John and I always had fun playing the characters,"" Loughlin told Today in March when discussing her fan-fave television relationship. ""We had a fun rapport. I guess it’s a relationship that people look up to and want to emulate. I just know that they are two really loved characters. People love them as a couple; they love them together, which is very nice.”

Plus, John and Lori are pals in real life. Theactors have recurring roles on Fuller House and if Lori's pics are any indication, it looks like the '90s sweethearts will be back to reprise their beloved characters for Season 4."

The record 37 new original holiday movies from Hallmark and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries are packed into a 10-week span, often with the sister stations premiering movies on the same night.

The new films are surrounded by nearly nonstop holiday programming thanks to Hallmark’s vast Christmas library.

Familiar faces will make the new movies feel like old friends with the return of Candace Cameron Bure, Lori Loughlin, Erin Krakow, Brennan Elliott, Luke MacFarlane and Danica McKeller.

Buffalo's Wendie Malick is back in the third film in the ""Father Christmas"" series, ""Marrying Father Christmas,"" and this time it looks like she may find holiday romance, too. It debuts Nov. 4 on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries.

A special treat for Buffalo viewers: Hometown guy Chad Michael Murray makes his Hallmark holiday debut in “Road to Christmas,” premiering Nov. 4.

The big theme this year is going home and reconnecting with loved ones: childhood best friends, high school sweethearts, teen crush and family members. The schedule is filled with the popular evergreen stories of big-city executives being won over by small-town charm, single parents learning to trust again, and the true meaning of Christmas being discovered while baking cookies, decorating trees, caroling and ice skating.

Return to Hope Valley for the now-annual Christmas Day movie based on Hallmark’s popular series, “When Calls the Heart.” This time, there may be a Christmas baby. And Hearties still mourning the death of Mountie Jack will be consoled by actor Daniel Lissing spending “Christmas in Love,"" premiering Nov. 11.

Eloise Mumford and Sean Faris, the charming stars of the Hallmark Hall of Fame's ""Christmas with Holly,"" reunite in ""A Veterans' Christmas"" on Nov. 11 on HM&M.

Noteworthy this year is a clear move toward more diversity in lead roles with the casting of such stars as Tia Mowry-Hardrict (""A Gingerbread Romance""), Jerrika Hinton (""A Majestic Christmas"") and Tatyana Ali and Dondre T. Whitfield (""Christmas Everlasting"").

Hallmark's fascination with Jane Austen's “Pride and Prejudice” continues with “Christmas at Pemberley Manor” and the unfortunately named “Pride and Prejudice and Mistletoe,” although all similarity may end in the titles.

I thought the Wake Up, San Francisco co-anchor was a stunner on Full House, but Lori Loughlin in real life these days is even better. Clearly anyone who's this much of knockout (that skin! those abs!) follows some type of regimen. Here's what the 52-year-old actress does to look —and feel — incredible.

1. SHE COOKS HEALTHY DINNERS.

Lori Loughlin

And Instagrams them, too. Just the other night Loughlin posted that she was making her dad's meatballs made from ground turkey (lean protein!), onion, garlic, and breadcrumbs with Giada's bolognese.

2. SHE LOVES BREAD.

See, stars are just like us! In a recent interview with People, Loughlin admitted she's a total carb lover, and is the first to dive into a bread basket at an Italian restaurant. But she tries to stay away from products made from white flour, instead reaching for complex carbohydrates like brown rice and quinoa. ""When I do have the white bread, the white flour, I just feel puffier and doughier,"" she told the magazine in November 2016. ""So I do try to be mindful of having protein and vegetables and a clean diet, really for my energy.""

3. SHE DRINKS HER VITAMINS.

Holy, washboard abs, Lori! In the past, the actress has favored yoga and pilates, but these days Loughlin's sweat session of choice is Body by Simone, an intense body-sculpting cardio program that targets women's glutes, thighs, arms, and core. When she can't make it to a class in L.A., she turns to Simone's DVD.

5. SHE GUZZLES A TON OF WATER.

That insanely glowing skin? Aside from getting regular facials, Loughlin sips the recommended 6 to 7 glasses of water a day. (Can't seem to stay hydrated? This water bottle might be for you.)

6. SHE BELIEVES IN MODERATION.

Loughlin's said in the past that she doesn't believe in the word ""diet"". Instead, she relies on portion control and trying to understand which ingredients make her feel great — and which make her crash.

She also brought her daughter Olivia Jade, who's already being mistaken for her mom's twin.

Olivia definitely does have other things in common with her mom: At just 18, she's a beauty influencer with around two million followers across platforms, getting started early on her career just like Loughlin, who began working as a print model at just 11 years old. It wasn't long before she moved on to a three-year stint on a soap opera at just 15, and, of course, eventually to Full House . Once the show ended, she divorced the investment banker she'd been married to—and kicked off her new life by spending her Thanksgiving eloping with Mossimo Giannulli, the fashion designer you may recognize from the aisles of Target, which carries his line Mossimo, or from bowling snapshots posted on the Instagram account of the pair's other daughter, Isabella Rose.

Loading View on Instagram

Just one year apart in age, Olivia Jade has over a million YouTube subscribers and over 700,000 Instagram followers, whereas Isabella Rose is a 19-year-old important enough to, even in this era of Hadids, has somehow nabbed the enviable Instagram handle @bella . (Their mom still has both of them beat, though, with 1.4 million Instagram followers of her own .)

Loading View on Instagram

Predictably enough, Olivia's YouTube provides the most insight into the family's life. In addition to informative vlogs like a ""Flawless Skin with No Makeup Tutorial,"" a roundup of the best beauty products of 2017, and Q&A sessions with themes like ""What It's Like to Have a Famous Mom ,"" there are also regular appearances from her mom, usually in the form of Olivia's annual quiz session, ""Teaching My Mom Slang Terms."" The 2017 edition starts with Loughlin dragging Olivia for always vlogging, making a wild guess that ""thot"" means ""too hot,"" and accusing her daughter's generation of ""ruin[ing] the word 'daddy.'""

Whereas Olivia's Instagram features plenty of glam shots and photo sessions with her mom when they ""got called twins allllllll night,"" Bella's tends to feature her and her friends. Still, the pair understandably have similar taste in #tbt's: Both are quite fond of posting throwbacks of her mom from her Full House days.

“‘Frozen’ in time w/ @loriloughlin,” Stamos, 54, wrote in the caption.

The two appeared to be in the Fuller House set, on which Loughlin, 53, appeared from behind the iconic red door to sit beside Stamos.

Stamos revealed to PEOPLE in 2015 that he and Loughlin shared “undeniable chemistry” while filming Full House.

“People loved seeing us together,” he said. “No disrespect to her family and her husband now, I would say that she could be the one that got away. She’s one of my dearest friends, and that’s good enough. I really do adore her.”

The Jesse and Becky chatter continued when the actress talked about Stamos in an interview the following year.

“I was actually married at the time that I was doing the show,” Loughlin said of the Full House years. “And then when I got divorced, [John] met Rebecca Romijn, and he got married so our timing was just really off. I don’t think it ever entered our minds that it would be something more.”"	['married', 'yeari', 'sandwiches', 'appeared', 'john', 'loughlin', 'door', 'singalong', 'lori', 'adorable', 'finish', 'frozen', 'really', 'house', 'chemistry', 'open', 'stamos']	"Friendship is an open door.

Olivia Jade Giannulli, 17, was filming herself driving before getting into a car accident, and she detailed the whole ordeal in a video she posted on Sunday night. The ""Fuller House"" star's daughter said she was at a red light when a truck smashed into her vehicle from behind, sending her into the car in front of her. She was coming home from a hair appointment at the time.

The controversial YouTube video in question has since been deleted, but screen shots were taken by DailyMail.

While on her way to the salon, the YouTube star is seen driving along some winding roads and singing along to Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered.""

After walking out of the salon, Giannulli gives a detailed recap of how her appointment went. The next scene shows her just after the crash. She describes the moment as ""very scary"" and tells the camera she is ""shaking"" before getting out of her vehicle.

Olivia then drives home, giving her viewers an update from her parked vehicle: ""I'm not hurt. My head hurts a little, but I was just more panicked I think.""

Though her viewers were glad she walked away unhurt, they were concerned that she was vlogging throughout the ordeal.

""It's so sad that now that YouTubers are getting into car crashes because they're on their phone or vlogging,"" one fan pointed out.

""I really have to say I hope this is a lesson to everyone thinking it's okay to text, OR vlog or make Insta/Snapchat while driving because IT IS NOT OKAY!!!"" another user wrote.

To which Olivia replied, ""I totally agree. ❤️ Safety first and i will never be doing any of that again.""



Clearly Loughlin's daughter learned her lesson, as she vowed to never text while driving again, emphasizing how dangerous it can be.

Other YouTube stars, such as Zoe Sugg -- known as Zoella to her followers -- have previously been slammed for recording herself while driving.

Loughlin's daughter has nearly one million subscribers on YouTube, rising to fame for her videos about fashion and makeup.

The six-bedroom home, owned by actor Charles Bronson in the 1970s and ‘80s, hit the market Thursday for $35 million. Mr. Loughlin and Ms. Giannulli bought the property only two years ago for just under $14 million and have since invested some $15 million into updates, said listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency.

Ms. Loughlin, famous for playing Aunt Becky in sitcom ""Full House"" and its current reboot, ""Fuller House,"" and Mr. Giannulli, who founded and then sold the Mossimo clothing brand, have lived in the home with their three kids. Mr. Rappaport called Mr. Giannulli a ""serial flipper, who has some of the most beautiful homes in Beverly Hills and Bel Air.""

The couple has renovated seven homes since they were married nearly two decades ago, according to a feature on the home by Elle Decor.

In this case, they have taken the 1929 shell of the Italianate-style villa and updated it with modern interiors—a trend Mr. Giannulli told Elle he saw in Europe.

They nearly doubled the size of the home to 12,000 square feet, adding a new kitchen and family room with a modern, industrial feel, including concrete floors and geometric iron windows, Elle reported.

The home also has a lap pool and spa views over the Bel Air Country Club golf course, according the listing. There’s ample room for outdoor entertaining, a gym, staff room, a paneled library and five-car garage.

The home’s Hollywood pedigree extends beyond Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Bronson. Columbia Pictures founder Harry Cohn built the original home—installing a basement speakeasy and the dramatic two-story skylight that still decorates the main entrance, according to Elle. Talent agent Johnny Hyde also lived there at one time, bringing then-struggling starlet Marilyn Monroe to the house before her break out.

Lori reportedly faces a felony charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She was arrested on Wednesday, but was later released on a $1 million bail.

Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose have reportedly dropped out of USC as a result of the backlash.

Olivia reportedly posted the video Sunday to her nearly 1 million subscribers. Daily Mail posted 6 screen grabs showing her behind the wheel, and reported Olivia vowed to never vlog or text while driving right after the accident.

57	https://www.brides.com/story/lori-loughlin-doesnt-know-her-wedding-date	[]	None	"It’s pretty bad to forget your anniversary altogether, but just getting the date wrong is at least a little better, right? Well, how about mistaking the date of your wedding anniversary for the past 20 years? Where does that fall on the scale? Let's ask Fuller House star Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion entrepreneur Mossimo Giannulli, who just realized that they have been celebrating their anniversary on the wrong day—for two entire decades.

The actress recently spilled her secret to a long-lasting marriage to Entertainment Tonight , and, while she was at it, shared this hilarious revelation.

""I was having dinner with Candace Cameron Bure and Marilu Henner, and you know, Marilu has that incredible memory,"" Loughlin began. ""Somehow we started talking about my elopement and I said, 'Yeah, we got up on Thanksgiving morning'... We had Moss' best friend and a minister meet us, and we got married at sunrise and then we went to Thanksgiving dinner and we told everybody.""

This was the second marriage for both Loughlin and Giannulli. She said that they originally considered having a traditional wedding , but one day—apparently on Thanksgiving—they decided to scrap the whole big to-do, and simply tie the knot in a low-key ceremony. You would thinking that since Loughlin and Giannulli's big day also happened to be Thanksgiving, it would be an easy day for the couple to remember. But, since the exact date of the holiday changes each year, things got confusing.

Loughlin continued, ""Marilu happened to say, 'Oh, what is your wedding date?' And I said, 'It's Nov. 25, 1997,' and she goes, 'No no, Nov. 25 was a Tuesday... Nov. 27, 1997 that was Thanksgiving,'"" And as it turns out, ""She was right!”

Marilu Henner might have just won BFF MVP for remembering her friend's correct wedding date after all these years. Henner is an actress, but her biggest claim to fame might be her ability to remember literally everything. She has a Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, which gives her the ability to recall the slightest details of almost every day she has lived, according to AARP . Clearly her special skills really came in handy for Loughlin who might have otherwise never realized the mistake, as the incorrect wedding date is even on her marriage certificate.

“...they had written Nov. 25 and that's what it says on my marriage license ,"" she said.

Regardless of the date, Loughlin and her hubby couldn’t be more in love.""He's my guy, he's my person,"" the actress said, adding what exactly makes their marriage work. ""It's communicating , it's listening, it's picking and choosing your battles. It's being flexible, it's all of that. One day at a time, one step at a time.”

And as for their anniversary snafu, Loughlin has the best idea for rectifying the situation. ""I called my husband, and I'm like, 'Oh my goodness, we have been celebrating two days early!'"" she said. ""So it's actually Nov. 27, 1997... I think we're going to make [our anniversary] a three-day festival now."""

Her ultimate beauty rules: My daughter Olivia [17] is a YouTube vlogger, and my daughter Bella [18] is a fashion blogger. They definitely try to guide me fashion- and beauty-wise. They're supportive and compliment me, but they definitely will step in to say, ""Don't wear that.""

Family traditions: Sunday nights we have dinner together, and we play games on game night; once a year, we get away to ski — when you get kids out of their home environment, they're forced to be with you and you have a captive audience.

“Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are asking a whopping $35 million for their Bel Air, California, mansion, Variety says.

The gated five-bedroom house borders a couple of sand traps on the Bel Air Country Club golf course. The contemporary Mediterranean features a two-story entryway with a grand staircase, and a master suite with his-and-her bathrooms and closets.

The back yard has a swimming pool and spa, and the garage off the circular motor court can hold five cars.

The house, which the couple bought in 2015 for about $14 million, is part of a string of real estate renovations they have completed, including a makeover of a 1920s Tuscan villa, a remodeling of a 1940s Georgian in Bel Air and an Aspen, Colo., contemporary.

Loughlin, 52, is best known for playing a supporting role in ABC’s sitcom “Full House” and for her recurring role in the sequel, “Fuller House.” On Thanksgiving 1997, Loughlin eloped with Giannulli, founder of the Mossimo clothing line, which he sold to Target in 2000 for a reported $135 million. They have two daughters."

ET's Deidre Behar sat down with the actress on Thursday, where she opened up about the secret to her long-lasting marriage, admitting that it clearly has nothing to do with remembering your anniversary. As Loughlin confessed, it wasn't until recently that she discovered she and Giannulli had been celebrating on the wrong day, thanks to Marilu Henner.

""I was having dinner with Candace Cameron Bure and Marilu Henner, and you know, Marilu has that incredible memory,"" she explained. ""Somehow we started talking about my elopement and I said, 'Yeah, we got up on Thanksgiving morning'... We had Moss' best friend and a minister meet us, and we got married at sunrise and then we went to Thanksgiving dinner and we told everybody.""

""Marilu happened to say, 'Oh, what is your wedding date?' And I said, 'It's Nov. 25, 1997,' and she goes, 'No no, Nov. 25 was a Tuesday... Nov. 27, 1997 that was Thanksgiving,'"" Loughlin continued. ""She was right! And on my marriage certificate, they had written Nov. 25 and that's what it says on my marriage license.""

""So I called my husband, and I 'm like, 'Oh my goodness, we have been celebrating two days early!'"" she said with a laugh. ""So it's actually Nov. 27, 1997... I think we're going to make [our anniversary] a three-day festival now.""

After 20 years of wedded bliss, the couple definitely deserves the celebration.

""Moss and I had both been married before, so we thought, 'Well, it didn't really work out well for us the first time around, so maybe we'll elope and see how it goes and tell people,'"" Loughlin recalled of their decision to tie the knot. ""We had talked about doing a wedding and we just thought, 'Let's get up and let's go do it.'""

""He's my guy, he's my person,"" she gushed, before revealing the qualities that make their marriage work. ""It's communicating, it's listening, it's picking and choosing your battles. It's being flexible, it's all of that.""

""One day at a time, one step at a time,"" she added.

RELATED: ‘When Calls The Heart’: ET Canada On The Set With Lori Loughlin

Olivia Jade Giannulli, 17, who has a YouTube following of nearly 1 million subscribers, posted a video Sunday detailing the crash, and featuring video filmed both before and after the incident while driving, the Daily Mail reported. The video has since been taken down.

Giannulli said a truck hit her vehicle from behind while she was waiting at a red light. She than attempted to continue driving, but a AAA driver who happened to witness the accident honked at her, and informed her that the back of her car was smoking.

“I don’t know if the man who hit me was texting or just purely wasn’t paying attention, but please always always look at the road when you’re driving. I promise to never vlog, text, etc. when I drive again because not only could you injure yourself, but you could hurt or kill another person,” Giannulli said.

Still, a number of fans took issue with the fact that Giannulli had been vlogging while driving in the first place. “I’m glad you’re okay—but I really have to say I hope this is a lesson to everyone thinking it’s okay to text, OR vlog or make insta/snapchat while driving because IT IS NOT OKAY!!!” one person commented on the YouTube video before it was taken down.

Loughlin has spoken out to defend her daughter in a video on TMZ, claiming that the piece in the Daily Mail had “misrepresented” the incident. “She was not on her phone. That was all absolute BS,” the “Fuller House” star insists."

The good news is that it seems as though Loughlin and her actual husband think this is all pretty funny.

In case you missed it, Stamos is expecting his first child with his wife, Caitlin McHugh. The two announced the news in December 2017, just two months after announcing their plans to wed. Loughlin is married to Mossimo Giannulli (who yes, is famous for the “Mossimo” brand), and the pair has two daughters together — Isabella and Olivia, both teens. It’s the second marriage for Loughlin, who divorced her first husband back in 1996.

""Whenever I post something with my husband, people will write comments,"" she said to Entertainment Tonight. ""I laugh now, I think its funny. They’re like, ‘You should’ve married John!’""

Giannulli, thankfully, finds it all pretty funny, too.

""What's even funnier though, is sometimes my husband will comment back and say, 'Yeah, you should have!' or something funny like that,"" she continued. ""Like, he'll just pop off!""

At least fans will always be able to relive Becky and Jesse’s chemistry in Full House reruns. And hey — sometimes they both appear on Fuller House, the uber-successful Netflix spinoff.

Loughlin is also more than supportive of all of Stamos’s big news and thinks he’s going to be an excellent father.

""I'm so excited for him,"" she said, noting that he's wanted a family for some time. ""It's long overdue and his wife is a really great girl. She's very good for him. I'm happy that they found each other, and I'm really excited that he's going to be a dad.""

If you're embracing all things nostalgic, you might be wondering how many Fuller House episodes are Becky and Jesse in this time round? The answer is a touch disappointing: they're in just two episodes. But even this is a little misleading, because audiences don't get blessed with the two Katsopolises at the same time.

Jesse shows up for the fifth installment of the new season, unaccompanied by his wife. The official narrative reason is that his producer wife is doing a show in New York for a few weeks, leaving him to look after their adopted baby Pamela alone. He's decided to visit D.J., Stephanie and Kimmy because he's ""jonesing for some adult conversation,"" but fate isn't on his side; the women are headed on a night out and leave him to babysit.

Which should be fine, right? He's cool uncle Jesse. Except that he's severely sleep deprived, and, according to him, his new baby is the only one he can't handle, because she's refusing to catch some shuteye. If you're wondering about the real reason why he appears wife-free in the episode and assuming it's because the actors, John Stamos and Lori Loughlin, have schedules that were too different to coordinate, the photo below suggests this isn't the case. Since Stamos is an executive producer on Fuller House, presumably this shows the pair goofing around backstage since they don't appear on any episodes together.

Loughlin appears for just one episode too, Episode 8, in which Aunt Becky shows up, ostensibly because she needs ""a vacation day from"" D.J.'s dad, news anchorman Danny. But it's actually because she's secretly organized an appointment for Stephanie to visit a fertility specialist. Sounds kind of intrusive, right? But it's because, as she tells the Steph, she knows ""how much you want to be a mom,"" referring to the fertility issues we learned the Tanner sister had way back in Season 1 Episode 5. During the episode, in a cryptic aside, the formerly London-based sister said she ""can't have children. I'm okay... I just found out a while ago it's not going to happen for me.""

It's worth noting that the storyline is a little surprising, given what series creator Jeff Franklin told TV Line back in February 2016, when he stressed that Stephanie not having children was a very deliberate choice on his part. Franklin explained that he ""wanted one of the three to not have kids.."" However, even then he did confirm that fertility treatments ""may be something that’s referenced again in the series,"" so maybe this has been in the pipeline since Season 1.

Netflix

Still, the two storylines do give us some hints why the pair couldn't appear in the same episode. Jesse's episode is about him being the only grown up in the house and facing the challenge of babysitting a whole gaggle of kids, plus his new daughter, alone. The stakes simply wouldn't be as high if he had his ultra competent wife by his side. And Becky's episode is all about her bonding with Stephanie over her desire for a child, something she also experienced recently (thus the adopted daughter). Plus, it's a pretty intimate appointment. Somehow, the whole surprising Steph with a trip to the fertility clinic trick would have made a lot less sense with Uncle Jesse along for the ride.

Besides which, it feels like the production team want to dole out the treats bit by bit. When Stamo and Loughlin first appear in their episodes, you can hear the audience whooping as they come through the door. Many viewers are tuning in mostly for the nostalgia aspect, and that gets more exciting when we don't get it all at once.

So no, it's not fair that we don't get to see Becky and Jesse together and that they're in a grand total of one episode each. But let's praise goddess that they're there at all. The show's all the richer for their performances."

The family friendly cheese of the original series still delights its generations of fans, as repeats have been played constantly on syndication since the show's original run ended in 1995. The iconography of Full House was still so relevant in modern pop culture that Netflix ended up bringing the cast back together for the revival series Fuller House. But there is a downside to the still rabid fandom, according to actress Lori Loughlin. Namely, that everyone wishes she married co-star John Stamos. Oh yes, whenever I post something with my husband, people will write comments. I laugh now, I think its funny. They're like, 'You should've married John!' It looks like people still really want to see Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse together. And while Full House fans know they're just actors doing their jobs, I guess their sweeping love story transcends logic and time. Lori Loughlin's comments are sure to delight those of us who grew up watching Full House. In the original sitcom, Jesse and Becky's romance was basically the main love story. Sure, Danny occasionally had a girlfriend, but the audience was never quite as invested in anyone else's love lives. Fans watched as the young couple fell in love, and eventually wed-- complete Jesse and the Rippers' song ""Forever"". I mean, look at these guys. With magic like that, it's no wonder that 90s kids everywhere want Lori Loughlin and John Stamos to be together in real life. And while they remain close and have continued working together in Fuller House, they're not a couple IRL. In her conversation with ET, Lori Loughlin reminds everyone that she'd been happily married to husband Mossimo Giannulli for twenty years. Soon John Stamos is about to follow in those shoes as well. Stamos is currently engaged to fiancee Caitlin McHugh, and the couple are expecting their first child. Uncle Jesse is going to have to get very parental in the near future, and it seems like straight out of an episode of the original series. Ff the fandom is still hoping that he and Loughlin become a couple, then they'll also be hoping that Stamos ends up having twin boys. Fuller House is currently streaming in its entirety on Netflix, including 9 episodes with Lori Loughlin's Aunt Becky.

They had apparently gone on a couple dates when they were 18 or 19, per Stamos, but then Loughlin got married and by the time that relationship ended, Stamos had already gotten together with his now ex-wife Rebecca Romijn."

The 50 year old actress confirmed to People magazine that she’ll be part of the reunion, and that she’s looking forward to getting back together with her old castmates. “Doing that show was one of the best jobs I've ever had,” she said, “it was just so much fun.”

Lori Loughlin is the latest to join the 'Fuller House' reunion on Netflix

The much-loved comedy ‘Full House’ originally ran on ABC for eight seasons between 1987 and 1995, and dealt with the efforts of a father, Danny Tanner (played by Bob Saget), left to raise his three children alone after his wife is killed in a car accident. He enlists the help of his brother-in-law and best friend to do so – with amusing results.

More: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen will not be joining ‘Full House’ reboot on Netflix

Loughlin is also confident that the reboot, which will come over two decades after the original series wrapped, will satisfy the hopes and expectations of the fans. “I think with Jeff Franklin at the helm – he's the creator of ‘Full House’ – it's hard to go wrong because nobody's more protective of that show than he is,” she believes. “That's his baby.”

‘Fuller House’ has already secured Candace Cameron Bure as eldest daughter D.J. from the original series, who faces a similar situation as her father – she’s widowed and raising her children with the help of her sister Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin). However, it’s already confirmed that fan favourites Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen will not be returning to portray Michelle.

Loughlin is currently starring in the Hallmark drama series ‘When Calls the Heart’, which is now in the middle of its second season. Since ‘Full House’ finished, she’s also had roles in ‘Summerland’ and ‘90210’, the spin-off series of ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’.

The series will follow DJ Tanner (Candace Cameron Bure), Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) and Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber) in their adult lives as they try to help DJ raise her children after the death of her husband.

The show will see most of the original stars return for the premiere, too ... except for the youngest member of the Tanner family. Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen have unfortunately chosen not to reprise their roles as Michelle Tanner.

""We would've loved it. It would've been great,"" Loughlin said about the Olsen twins' decision to not return. ""But I understand.""

LOS ANGELES, June 3 (UPI) -- Lori Loughlin refuses to wear a corset for When Calls the Heart.

The 50-year-old actress recently discussed the Hallmark Channel period drama with People. The series is currently in its second season, and stars Loughlin as early 20th century coal mine widow Abigail Stanton.

""They try every season to put me in a corset and I say, 'Okay, I'll try it,' and I really, honestly, only make it lunchtime and then I have to take it off because I can't breathe,"" she told the magazine.

When Calls the Heart follows teacher Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) as she establishes herself in the small community and develops a relationship with Mountie Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing). Loughlin expressed appreciation for the show's strong female characters in the interview.

""[The series features] women that are independent, women that are working,"" she shared. ""It seems like it's the beginning of the women's movement, and I think that's all relatable to today ... Women are becoming stronger and are more independent and leaning on each other.""

When Calls the Heart airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. ET. In addition to the period drama, Loughlin will appear on Full House reboot Fuller House in 2016. The actress confirmed she will reprise Aunt Becky for the upcoming Netflix series last week."

Lori Loughlin (you know her as the perky, no-nonsense Aunt Becky from Full House) is a secret serial renovator. Well, her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, is anyway. The couple has owned and renovated seven homes in Los Angeles, and their recent project was especially interesting — they took a 1929 Italianesque villa, and turned it on its head with contemporary touches like black marble floors and lots of angular furniture.

""My girlfriends say, 'You're a saint,'"" Loughlin told Elle Decor, while offering the magazine a tour of the newly redesigned space. ""But it's always been [Mossimo's] passion, and I roll with it because he does the heavy lifting. I know it will turn out beautifully.""

We're going to be glued to our seats when Full House reboots on Netflix next year, but until then, we'll gladly accept this peek into Aunt Becky's post-Wake Up San Francisco life to tide us over.

78	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lori-loughlin-aunt-becky-confirmed-to-return-for-fuller-house/	['Amanda Mikelberg']	None	"The ""Fuller House"" family is growing!

Lori Loughlin stopped by ""Good Morning America"" Thursday to make a big announcement -- she's hopped on-board for Netflix's ""Full House"" spinoff, ""Fuller House,"" to begin taping 20 years after the original show ended.

Loughlin, who played Aunt Becky and lived in the Tanner family attic with Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) and their twin sons Nicky and Alex, said she is ""very excited"" to be a party to the momentous revival of the hit '90s sitcom set San Francisco.

""It's going to be really great to be back with the whole cast. It'll be a lot of fun,"" Loughlin said. ""We're going to help Candace [Cameron Bure], Jodi [Sweetin] and Andrea [Barber] spin off the new show. So we'll come back and do the first episode and maybe throughout we'll pop up here and there.""

""Fuller House"" will premiere in 2016 with 13 episodes that reunite many of the Tanner actors: In addition to Cameron Bure, Sweetin and Barber, Stamos has promised to return for some key cameos and Bob Saget (who played dad Danny Tanner) will reportedly return for some laughs and hugs.

One pair of cast members not returning for the reboot are Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who shared the role of youngest sister Michelle Tanner in the original series.

But Loughlin isn't passing judgment on her TV-niece(s) for not signing up with the Tanners 2.0.

""We would've loved it. It would've been great,"" Loughlin said on ""GMA"" of the Olsens not returning. ""But I understand."""

Dive a little deeper, however, and the popular Hallmark Channel series reveals rich layers of redemption and forgiveness — along with day-to-day struggles that tug on the heartstrings.

“I really enjoy taking characters on an emotional journey,” said showrunner Alfonso Moreno in an email interview with the blog From the Desk of Kurt Manwaring. “There is no more powerful journey than the road to redemption.""

And of all the characters on ""When Calls the Heart,"" mine owner and resident bad guy Henry Gowen, played by actor Martin Cummins, ""has the longest road to redemption because he has historically done the most harm to others,” Moreno said. Henry bears responsibility for a multitude of sins ranging from embezzlement to the death of the town’s miners.

“There’s so much that’s happened over the time period with this guy,” Cummins said in a phone interview. “He’s the head of the mine and then the mine goes down. And then he’s charged. And then he’s the mayor. And then he’s in prison. I’ve had two trials. And (on it goes).”

Henry has evolved over the years to the point where, although once hated, he's now a fan favorite. As an actor, Cummins cheers for his character’s redemption but points out Henry doesn’t feel the same way — especially as it relates to the deadly mining disaster in Season 1.

“He feels responsible for it. 100 percent,” said Cummins. “That’s something he’s going to have to live with for the rest of his life.”

Yet despite the gravity of his sins, there are periodic glimmers of light for this character on a slow-but-steady arc of redemption. One of Henry’s greatest advocates is Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin) — an entrepreneurial and kindhearted woman who lost her husband and son to Henry’s greed.

David Dolsen, ©2019 Crown Media United States LLC The relationship between Henry Gowen (Martin Cummins) and Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin) continues to develop in Season 6 of 'When Calls the Heart.'

The surprisingly tender moments shared between the two characters have led to a variety of fan responses.

“The audience realized it and the network realized it, and went, ‘Oh, this is interesting, what’s happening here (between Henry and Abigail),'” Cummins said.

For Cummins, these reactions are understandable, but Loughlin's and his character's complicated relationship is likely on a slow burn.

“It didn’t get heavy-handed and all the sudden next week they’re dating and they’re married on Tuesday,” said Cummins. “This whole thing is played out over six seasons. I think they’re standing on opposite ends of the room kind of looking at each other on and off, but we’re not moving anywhere quickly.”

Henry may need to wait for love and redemption, but the town of Hope Valley will have a variety of changes to deal with almost as soon as the new season begins — including the introduction of the telephone and stock market.

“In more ways than one, future comes knocking at the door of Hope Valley,” Moreno said. “The challenge for our characters is how do they hold onto the best of the past while moving into the future.

“Also, the fortunes of some of our residents change dramatically this season,” he added.

Moreno didn't say exactly who might be part of a rags-to-riches (or riches-to-rags) storyline. But he does want fans to know the new season will be filled with all the things they love and plenty of new ones as well.

“In Season 6, we have some new faces and new exciting stories to tell. The series continues to provide the emotion, romance and humor that has made it successful,” said Moreno.

“The storylines will have twists and turns and have real emotional stakes, while remaining true to the Hallmark brand. ‘When Calls the Heart’ continues to be a show that your whole family can genuinely enjoy.”

John Stamos and his wife Caitlin McHugh welcomed their first child, a baby boy named William Christopher Stamos, who was born at 8:32 p.m on Tuesday, April 10th.

“It was about 20 minutes. It was weird. It was super fast,” Stamos said about the delivery while appearing on the April 19th episode of On Air with Ryan Seacrest. “A little baby came out and he looked just like Don Rickles.” Lolol.

Nicknamed Billy, Stamos is over the moon about the new arrival. And so are his cast mates. Specifically, his Full House love Aunt Becky (aka Lori Loughlin). Loughlin has two daughters with husband Mossimo Giannulli (yes, of the brand) and can probably dish out a ton of parenting advice if Stamos is ever in need.

Of course, he was such a natural parental figure on Full House that he probably doesn’t need it.

""Hey, hey, Mr. Stamos,"" says Loughlin. ""We all want to come and meet Billy, but see you're home with a newborn baby and I'm hanging out with the cool crowd.""

Loughlin’s daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, are standing next to her in the video. (Awww.) Stamos shared the tribute with the sweet words, saying, “Can’t wait for Billy to meet his great, great, great Aunt Becky and clan.” And when it does, please film it, guys!

Hallmark’s famed Christmas movies have been known for revisiting the same stable of stars — which until recently, hasn’t left much room for faces that aren’t white. But this season, the brand has made an effort for diversity. It’s no longer a whitewashed Christmas on Hallmark, though it still has a way to go for a truly inclusive winter wonderland.

Previously, people of color were only relegated to supporting roles such as the sassy best friend or goofy co-worker. Though to be fair, Hallmark did occasionally cast biracial white-passing actresses like Jessica Szohr, Katrina Law, Alexa PenaVega, or new duchess Meghan Markle as the romantic lead. A few years ago, Hallmark even had a partnership with Mariah Carey, which resulted in her appearing in and directing “A Christmas Melody,” about putting on a school’s Christmas pageant.

But after that brief partnership ended, inclusion hadn’t really been prioritized until recently. Last year tested the waters with “Christmas in Evergreen,” which starred Holly Robinson Peete in a main, but not leading, role. The actress also starred in her own reality show “Meet the Peetes” that debuted this year on Hallmark.

The 2018 Christmas lineup, which features a total of 38 movies, finally made the leap to feature four women of color in starting roles: Jerrika Hinton, Christina Milian, Tia Mowry-Hardrict, and Tatyana Ali, the last of whom has the honor of starring in this year’s Hallmark Hall of Fame movie “Christmas Everlasting.” While this is a good sign, Hallmark still has a way to go opening up the leading roles to other ethnicities and marginalized people, which is an industry-wide issue: Hollywood only just recently featured its first Asian rom-com cast with “Crazy Rich Asians.”

Hallmark’s closest Christmas rom-com competitor Lifetime (which delivers 14 movies this season) has featured inclusive casting for years, in addition to interracial couples. In fact, Ali, Milian, and Mowry-Hardrict had all previously starred in Lifetime Christmas rom coms, and Hinton did the same at ION, another network trying to wiggle its way into the Christmas movie game.

“There was work that needed to be done, and we felt that we made a really good effort this year,” said Crown Media’s executive vice president of programming Michelle Vicary. “We continue to look at expanding our roster of talent to be reflective of the U.S. population.”

David Owen Strongman/Hallmark

Part of that endeavor is also looking at different types of underrepresented characters and family members, such as veterans, adoptees (“Road to Christmas” features a lead whose two brothers are adopted), and even pets, as seen in the feline-friendly “The Nine Lives of Christmas.” The fur-friendly stories fall in line with Adoption Ever After, Hallmark’s corporate pet initiative, which aims to educate the public about the many rewards of pet adoption.

One area that is underserved across all networks is the lack of LGBTQ representation in its Christmas movies. The rare example of a made-for-TV Christmas movie with an explicit gay storyline is the former ABC Family’s “Holiday in Handcuffs,” starring Melissa Joan Hart and Kyle Howard, who plays her gay brother. Other movies only hint at queer stories — such as the best friend in Netflix’s “A Christmas Prince,” or one of the adopted brothers in Hallmark’s movie “Road to Christmas.”

In a Times-Standard story decrying the lack of LGBTQ characters in holiday movies, a statement from Hallmark reads, “There are no forced values associated with our networks with the exception that we want to provide a quality viewing experience for every member of the family … We are not an issues-oriented network: our goal is for every viewer who comes to us to feel happier and better because they watched.”

Steven Ackerman/Hallmark

However, there’s still hope for Hallmark, which has been queer-friendly in its greeting card business, advertising, and with its talent. Out actor Luke Macfarlane has starred in numerous Hallmark movies, including this year’s “A Shoe Addict’s Christmas” as the love interest for Candace Cameron Bure. Similarly, Robert Gant has wooed (and won) Debbie Gibson in two movies for the network.

In its most festive move for inclusion yet, Hallmark recently announced that it won’t just be looking at Christmas for next year’s holiday slate. “We put two Hanukkah properties into development on our plate that we hope we’ll hope to get to air in 2019,” Vicary confirmed, noting that Christmas overlaps with the Festival of Lights next year, which takes place Dec. 22-30.

Including more people of color and Jewish holidays onscreen is just the beginning. Vicary said, “We are just getting started. We are going to have a lot of terrific announcements, some of which we can’t say yet. We’re finalizing deals, that I do promise when you hear them, you’ll see why I had to hold on tightly to these announcements.”

An area that Hallmark excels in that doesn’t get enough attention is its multigenerational casting, specifically putting women over 30 in the spotlight. Using former ‘90s sitcom or soap stars results in the women who tend to be older than the usual rom-com leads: Bure, Danica McKellar, and Alicia Witt are all in their 40s, while another “Full House” alum, Lori Loughlin, is 54. Sure, younger faces appear on the network, but the above are arguably Hallmark’s most bankable stars, in addition to Lacey Chabert, who is a spry 36.

Kailey Schwermann/Hallmark

This might not be too surprising considering that women aged 25-54 is its target demographic, and that Hallmark has a good record with women behind the scenes as well.

“This year we went and looked at our entire slate for 2018, and 55 percent of all of the movies were written by women,” said Vicary. Gender parity with directors is another matter though. “About 18-19 percent of our movies are directed by women. The industry needs to catch up because it has largely been a male-dominated career. We are making great strides I think with women, but continuing our diversity slate is going to be critical in 2019.”

Aunt Becky. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Invision/AP)

Have mercy — Lori Loughlin is 52.

If you're of a certain age, chances are you can't bring up the actress' name without someone interjecting and asking,"" You mean Aunt Becky?""

Because, despite Loughlin's other maternal roles — Ava Gregory in Summerland, or the updated version of Mrs. Walsh in the 90210 reboot — to most millennials she will always be Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis from Nebraska.

To celebrate this Fuller House star's birthday, we've made a list of reasons why we will love Aunt Becky Forever.

1. Her hairdos

Aunt Becky traversed the light and dark sides during seven seasons of Full House, and our younger selves pined after every look. Check out this style that made the highly-coveted ""Rachel"" look like a downgrade.

2. She is the definition of a ride or die

Despite his Elvis obsession or how many times he uttered ""have mercy"" after kissing her, Aunt Becky absolutely adored Uncle Jesse. She even rushed to his side after he was arrested when he was thoughtless enough to go skydiving on their wedding day.

She also gave up her apartment to live with Uncle Jesse in the Tanner's attic (with all of those people), because he missed living with his family. She and Jesse eventually raised their twins, Nicky and Alex there. Talk about being low maintenance.

It probably doesn't hurt that Uncle Jesse is so cute, has the voice of an angel, and sent her a ridiculous amount of roses on the first season of Fuller House. No wonder they wanted to renew their vows after 25 years together.

3. She was Pinteresting even before it was a thing

Okay, so maybe she wasn't soaking any oats overnight — though that probably would've made getting ready for her morning talk show easier — but Aunt Becky did plan a creative dinner to tell Uncle Jesse she was pregnant, which today would be worthy of social media bragging. Baby shrimp, baby corn, and baby back ribs? C'mon Uncle J, put it together!

4. She reinforced the idea that a woman can have a life outside of the home

Being a stay-at-home mom is certainly an honorable job, but it just wasn't for Aunt Becky. She worked so hard on Wake Up, San Francisco that she was made a producer in season eight. Eventually, she and Danny got their own national talk show, Wake Up, USA.

5. She had the best advice

Praise be to the single dads. It's got to be hard for a girl being raised by three men (created for comedic purposes) and a woodchuck. Thankfully, Aunt Becky was a heart and a hand to hold onto.

She taught D.J., who was way too zealous with the eye shadow, how to apply makeup so it looked like she wasn't wearing any. (If you have the same minimal makeup goals, click here). She also helped Michelle build her downhill soap box derby racer — and learned not to make anti-feminist jokes in the process.

So, today we'd like to wish you the happiest of birthdays, Lori Loughlin. Thank you for bringing your warmth to this unforgettable character.

After all, what's more relaxing than watching an overworked woman fall in love with a Christmas tree farmer? So decompress with all of our delightful holiday content right here.

Lacey Chabert played Regina George's loyal follower Gretchen Weiners in Mean Girls, one of those rare movies that's become more than just entertainment—it's a stitch in pop culture's very fabric. The Tina Fey–crafted film is quoted constantly and referenced religiously; it has a signature song and color. There's even a day named after it.

But with all that hysteria, Mean Girls still isn't the project Chabert is asked about the most. Rather, she says, the people who watch her Hallmark Christmas movies are the most passionate. ""The fans of the Hallmark movies are incredibly loyal and devoted, and it's actually enabled me to connect more with them and the people that enjoy the movies,"" she says. ""They’re so vocal on social media, and I don’t think I'd experienced that to the level I experience now.""

""Loyal and devoted"" is a bit of an understatement. Hallmark has turned its holiday-movie-making business into a full-on cultural phenomenon. A whopping 72 million people tuned into Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas lineup last year, according to figures provided by the network. Hallmark also brought in the highest ratings on TV for households and women ages 18–49 and 25–54 during the week of November 20, 2017, largely because of its Christmas content. These holiday movies are so popular, in fact, that Hallmark upped its premiere count from 21 to 37—that's 16 more movies than last year. Audiences truly can't get enough.

Nor can the actresses who appear in the films. When I spoke to Chabert, she was about to start work on her sixteenth Hallmark movie, and she's not alone. Lori Loughlin has appeared in three Hallmark Christmas films, not to mention dozens of other projects for the network; Danica McKellar has several Hallmark movies under her belt, including three holiday ones; Alicia Witt's done a Hallmark Christmas movie every year since 2013; and Holly Robinson Peete's holiday movie was so popular in 2017 that a sequel is coming out this year. These women all have busy schedules—both personally and professionally—yet they still carve out time each year for some Christmas magic."

Have mercy!

Lori Loughlin showed off her ripped stomach muscles in an Instagram post over the weekend, proving that a busy schedule is no excuse to slack off on exercising. The ""Fuller House"" actress, who also stars on the Hallmark Channel drama ""When Calls the Heart,"" credited her trainer, Simone De La Rue, for helping her to achieve those enviable washboard abs.

""Sweaty Saturday with @bodybysimone the best way to start the weekend,"" Loughlin captioned the photo, which spurred quite the reaction from her Instagram followers.

“Aunt Becky’s killin’ it,” one wrote in the comments section of the post.

“Whoa baby,” another wrote in a nod to the famous ""Full House"" catchphrase. ""I’m envious!”

De La Rue, who also trains celebs such as Amber Valletta and Julianne Hough, reposted Loughlin’s pic and added praise for her client in the caption.

“Saturday inspiration! Look at that body @loriloughlin #squadgoals #girlsquad #girlfriendworkout,” De La Rue wrote.

Loughlin, 51, has been a fan of De La Rue’s dance cardio classes for years.

""I'll go do the Body by Simone because I don't love doing cardio. I have to trick myself to do it,"" the mom of two told People last year. ""They're not hard classes, anyone can do them. They're little dance aerobic classes. But I go and I jump around for 40 minutes and I work up a sweat and then we do some leg lifts and arms with little free weights.”

Loughlin has also credited yoga with helping to keep her body in tip-top shape. Last summer, a photo she posted of herself doing a side plank pose went viral, much to her surprise.

""I did not expect that photo to go viral like that. But ... it was very flattering,” she later told WonderWall.

Loughlin also attributes her trim figure to using moderation when it comes to eating treats and drinking alcohol.

“I'm not a big drinker,” she told People. “I love champagne but I don't have champagne every night. If I go out and I want to have a drink, I'll have a glass of champagne.”

Stamos dated Loughlin when they first broke into the entertainment industry, but the relationship ended long before they played a married couple on Full House.

The 49-year-old has now admitted that he regrets not committing more seriously to his romance with Loughlin.

""We actually did date, we went on a date to Disneyland before we were both married. In real life, when we were 18, 19,"" Huff Post Live quotes Stamos as saying.

He continued: ""We did have some off timing, but no disrespect to her family and her husband now, I would say that she could be the one that got away.""

Stamos added that he is at least thankful to have a very close friendship with Loughlin.

""She's one of my dearest friends and that's good enough,"" he said. ""But I really do adore her. She has a great husband and he's got a lot of money.""

Loughlin reunited with Full House co-stars Stamos, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and Candace Cameron for a get-together last autumn.

Aunt Becky.

“Happy Birthday to one of the best. Love you tons,” Loughlin wrote.

Bob Saget and Dave Coulier joined Loughlin in the well wishes, referring to Stamos as a “brother.”

The two recently reunited for Netflix’s Full House follow-up, and though they’ve been busy with filming this summer, the cast took time to celebrate the actor’s birthday earlier this month. Candace Cameron-Bure, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, and Scott Weinger all gathered for a poolside party, documenting the whole get-together on Instagram.

While Fuller House won’t premiere to Netflix until 2016, Stamos’ next project, Grandfathered, is set to debut on Sept. 29 at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.

92	https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Lori-Loughlin-Talks-Fuller-House-December-2015-39402490	['Caitlin Gallagher']	2015-12-19 20:00:00-08:00	"Lori Loughlin was a staple in just about everyone's childhood, playing cool Aunt Becky on the beloved sitcom Full House. And now, more than 20 years after the Tanner family went off the air, the world is getting ready for their return in the Netflix reboot Fuller House. We recently sat down with Lori to talk about what it was like being back on set again after all these years, whether or not she watches the show's reruns, and what her daughters, Olivia and Isabella, think of it all. The actress, who is partnering with Walgreens this Christmas to share her tips on easy and thoughtful gifting, also opened up about John Stamos's recent Paper magazine cover, where he shows his bare butt. Keep reading for the full interview, then check out the best photos of the Full House cast hanging out in real life.

POPSUGAR: Everyone is really excited about Fuller House. What was it like the first few days to be back on set? Was it as if no time had passed at all?

Lori Loughlin: In some ways, it really was as if no time had passed at all. It was a little bit surreal. And we were over at Warner Brothers, so to walk on the soundstage again, right next to the original soundstage where we shot the show, to see the set again, it was just unbelievable. It was magical, surreal, and emotional. And in many ways it was like we had never left. We picked up right where we left off. We were laughing, we had fun, we had a good time. It was really wonderful.

PS: What was your favorite part or memory from being back on set?

LL: I think just getting back together with everybody was so fun, and then Dave Coulier is just so funny. He had us in stitches as usual. And again, it was so familiar. Some of the jokes that were so funny 20-something years ago, we were kind of re-creating. And then all the behind-the-scenes funny things that had happened we were talking about and laughing about. It was just great. I don't really know how to put it into words. It was a wonderful, wonderful thing to think that you might never go home again, and then there you are, you're home again. I have such fond memories of being on that show, I loved every minute. I love everybody that I worked with on that show, so to reunite with all of them was just so special and it was a dream come true. Probably something I didn't ever think would happen, which was a nice surprise.

PS: Full House is still on TV all the time. Do you stop and watch it when you pass it or do you just keep going?

LL: No, sometimes I'll pause and watch it, just for a moment. Sometimes it's been so long it takes me a minute to remember what episode it is.

PS: Are your daughters fans of the show?

LL: They are, but I wouldn't say they're avid fans. They don't watch all the time, but they certainly know everyone on the show. And when we were doing the spinoff, Fuller House, the episode I was on, they would come down to the filming of the show and hang out with everyone.

PS: I also have to ask about John Stamos's recent Paper magazine shoot. Did you see it? Did you know it was happening?

LL: I did see it, and yes I did know it was happening. You know, what can I say is, if you've got it, flaunt it!

PS: Switching gears to the holidays, what are some of your favorite family traditions?

LL: Oh my goodness, we love to go skiing around the holidays. We always go to the mountains for Christmas to make it a white Christmas. In the morning we get up, we unwrap gifts, and have breakfast together. We play board games like Scrabble or Monopoly and just hang out. It's mostly just a good time to regroup with the family and spend quality time together. That's what I love about the holidays.

PS: Can you talk about your partnership with Walgreens? Do you have any tips for thoughtful gifting?

LL: That's what I love about Walgreens, you can get so many thoughtful gifts this holiday season that'll spread unexpected joy to almost everyone on your list. And what I also like is many of the gifts are $25 and under, but they're great quality. You can find affordable gifts for teachers, babysitters, dog-walkers, the mail carrier. The photo gifts are my favorite because you can personalize them. I think a holiday ornament with your child's photo on it is a wonderful gift for a grandparent. You can also do calendars, mugs with photos, t-shirts, the list goes on. There's great beauty products. My younger daughter loves makeup, so I'm going to do stocking stuffers for her. Walgreens has a great set of makeup brushes that I know she'll love. And what I also like about that is it's convenient, it's easy. It takes a lot of stress off of your plate, especially with their convenient store hours and being open late. Walgreens has really gone out of their way to help you, the customer, this holiday season to be successful.

PS: You've had a few really adorable outings with your daughters this year. I know you mentioned the makeup brushes, but are there any other things that are on their lists?

LL: Well, my younger daughter loves makeup, and she particularly loves drugstore makeup, which is why Walgreens is so great. I can get so many eye shadow palettes, mascaras, and body lotions there, too. There's just an array of stuff I can get for her. In fact, I could do almost all her shopping at Walgreens.

PS: What's on your list this year?

LL: I haven't even made a list — I haven't even started my Christmas shopping! That's what the joke is. I was on Walgreens.com last night and I've already earmarked a bunch of stuff I'm going to get. I'm the type of person who, truthfully, I love to give a gift more than I like to get a gift."
