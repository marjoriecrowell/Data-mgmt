"Notes"
"As data are reported voluntarily by providers to state or area health departments, information may be incomplete and result in undercounting abortions when calculating rates and ratios in some states."
""
"Abortions by state of occurrence include abortions obtained by non-residents of the state as well as those obtained by residents."

"Sources"
"[Abortion Surveillance - United States, 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm). Table 2. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Vol 67, No SS-13; 1-45. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, November 23, 2018."

"Definitions"
"*N/A*: Not applicable."

"*NR*: State did not report; because numbers for this state are available only from other states where residents obtained abortions, meaningful figures cannot be presented."
""
"*NSD*: Not sufficient data."


Footnotes
"1. Because reporting is not mandatory, a complete number of abortions performed in the District of Columbia could not be obtained and were only reported for area residents."
"2. Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women's centers, a complete count of abortions performed in New Jersey could not be obtained."
