"Notes"
"The federal Hyde Amendment, passed in 1977, bans state use of federal Medicaid dollars to pay for abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the abortion is ""necessary to save the life of the woman."" States can use their own funds to cover other medically necessary abortions - usually defined by states as those to protect the physical or mental health of the woman - for Medicaid beneficiaries."
