""
"*Hospital admitting privileges*: Hospital privileges laws require doctors who perform abortion to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a certain distance of the clinic."
""
"*Hospital admitting privileges or alternative agreements for clinicians required*: State requires providers to have either admitting privileges or an alternative agreement. Alternative agreements include an agreement with another physician who has admitting privileges, or other arrangements."

Footnotes
"1. Law is temporarily enjoined pending a court decision."
"2. Applies only to clinics providing surgical abortions."
"3. In most states, regulations apply to all abortion providers or apply to providers who perform or administer more than a small number of abortions. In Illinois, requirements apply only to sites where abortion is the primary service."
"4. Indiana law requires an abortion provider to either have admitting privileges or an agreement with another physician who has admitting privileges at a local hospital. A court has blocked a requirement that would have required the agreement with another physician who has privileges to be renewed annually and filed in every hospital in the local area."
"5. Law is permanently enjoined and is not in effect."
