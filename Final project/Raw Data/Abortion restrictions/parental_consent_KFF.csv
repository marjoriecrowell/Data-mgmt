"Notes"
"Unless otherwise noted, policies require the involvement of one parent."

"In states where policies are in effect (except Maryland, Missouri, and Ohio), minors are able to obtain an abortion without parental consent/notification in a medical emergency. These states also have an alternative process for minors seeking an abortion, including a judicial bypass procedure, which allows a minor to obtain approval from a court."
