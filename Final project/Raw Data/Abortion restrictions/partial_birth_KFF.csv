"Notes"
"So-called ""*partial birth abortion*"" is not a medical term. These bans may be interpreted to prohibit certain abortion procedures including the D&X procedure (dilation and extraction) used in a small share of second trimester abortions. These bans may also be interpreted to apply to the more common second trimester D&E procedure (dilation and evacuation), which has led to controversy about the bans' scope."
