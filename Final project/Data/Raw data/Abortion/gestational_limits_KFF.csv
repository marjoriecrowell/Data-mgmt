"Notes"
"The U.S. Supreme Court has held that states may constitutionally ban or restrict abortions after the point of fetal viability except where necessary to preserve a woman's life or health."

"Definitions"
"*Viability* is defined by the Supreme Court as ""the capacity for meaningful life outside the womb, albeit with artificial aid"" and not just ""momentary survival""."
""
"*LMP*: Calculates the beginning of pregnancy from a women's last menstrul period. States that do not explicitly enumerate the manner in which gestational age should be determined are labeled as ""LMP"" in keeping with standard medical practice."
""
"*Postfertilization*: Calculates the beginning of pregnancy from the date of conception; 20 weeks postfertilization is equivalent to 22 weeks LMP."
""
"*Post-implantation*: Calculates the beginning of pregnancy from the date of implantation; 24 weeks post-implantation is equivalent to 27 weeks LMP."
""
"*N/A*: Not applicable."


Footnotes

"2. An Idaho law that bans abortion at 20 weeks postfertilization is permanently enjoined by court order and not enforceable; policy not in effect."
