"Notes"
"Some states have passed laws and policies that require a woman seeking an abortion to receive information on accessing ultrasound services, while others require that a woman undergo an ultrasound before an abortion. Routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of a first-trimester abortion."

"3. Woman must be provided with written information on accessing ultrasound services. In Michigan, information is included in written counseling materials but not specifically mandated by law."

"5. If an ultrasound is requested by the woman, the provider will also display the image so that the woman can view it."
"6. This law is permanently enjoined by court order; policy not in effect."
