# Data-mgmt-final-project
Final project for data management class

## Contents of repository
I have uploaded for this project a colab notebook and 3 data files in .csv format. 

## Data files and information
The three data files 
	
	* one file from the Kaiser Family Foundation with data by state, looking at which states have expanded Medicaid
	* one file from the U.S. Census bureau with data by state, looking at the number of people with and without health insurance by poverty status
	* one file from the Guttmacher Institute with data by state, showing the abortion rate in each state and the changes in that rate between 2011 and 2014
	
Because all of these files have aggregated data at the state level, I merged them on the state variable. 

## Potential research questions
I'm not entirely sure what my research question will be, but I think I'm going to look at different rates of abortion incidence or maternal mortality by state and look at whether these vary by status of Medicaid expansion, poverty status, or health insurance coverage by state. A few questions I am considering are as follows:
	
	* "Does state incidence of abortion vary by whether the state has expanded Medicaid?" 
	* "Is Medicaid expansion in a state associated with lower rate of maternal mortality?"
