"Notes"
"Many states require waiting periods between provider counseling and the abortion procedure. These mandatory waiting periods may require a woman to make two trips to the health care provider if the state requires the woman to receive counseling in person (as opposed to telephone, video call, or another avenue). "
""
"All states waive mandatory waiting period requirements in a medical emergency or when the woman's life or health is threatened."
